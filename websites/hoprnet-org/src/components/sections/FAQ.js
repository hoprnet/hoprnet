        need to trust us because we do not operate the HOPR network. As long as one (out of typically three) relayers
        that send your data to the recipient is doing their job well, the connection data remain private. HOPR provides
        additional layers of data privacy protection by mixing packets along the route and making all packets look
        indistinguishable from one another. This is how HOPR establishes privacy in unprecedented ways.
