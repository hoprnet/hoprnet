//! Composable first-order predicate trait.
//!
//! This library implements an interface to "predicates" - boolean-valued
//! functions of one argument. This allows combinatorial logic to be created and
//! assembled at runtime and then used one or more times for evaluating values.
//! This sort of object is really useful when creating filters and checks that
//! can be changed at runtime with user interaction - it allows a clean
//! separation of concerns where the configuration code can be used to build up
//! a predicate, and then that predicate can be given to the code that does the
//! actual filtering without the filtering code knowing anything about user
//! configuration. See the examples for how this can work.
