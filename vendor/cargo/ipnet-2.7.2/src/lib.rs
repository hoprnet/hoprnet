//! Types for IPv4 and IPv6 network addresses.
//!
//! This module provides types and useful methods for working with IPv4
//! and IPv6 network addresses, commonly called IP prefixes. The new
//! [`IpNet`], [`Ipv4Net`], and [`Ipv6Net`] types build on the existing
//! [`IpAddr`], [`Ipv4Addr`], and [`Ipv6Addr`] types already provided in
//! Rust's standard library and align to their design to stay
//! consistent.
//! 
//! The module also provides the [`IpSubnets`], [`Ipv4Subnets`], and
//! [`Ipv6Subnets`] types for iterating over the subnets contained in
//! an IP address range. The [`IpAddrRange`], [`Ipv4AddrRange`], and
//! [`Ipv6AddrRange`] types for iterating over IP addresses in a range.
//! And traits that extend `Ipv4Addr` and `Ipv6Addr` with methods for
//! addition, subtraction, bitwise-and, and bitwise-or operations that
//! are missing in Rust's standard library.
//!
//! The module only uses stable features so it is guaranteed to compile
//! using the stable toolchain.
//!
//! # Organization
//!
//! * [`IpNet`] represents an IP network address, either IPv4 or IPv6.
//! * [`Ipv4Net`] and [`Ipv6Net`] are respectively IPv4 and IPv6 network
//!   addresses.
//! * [`IpSubnets`], [`Ipv4Subnets`], and [`Ipv6Subnets`] are iterators
//!   that generate the smallest set of IP network addresses bound by an
//!   IP address range and minimum prefix length. These can be created
//!   using their constructors. They are also returned by the
//!   [`subnets()`] methods and used within the [`aggregate()`] methods.
//! * [`IpAddrRange`], [`Ipv4AddrRange`], and [`Ipv6AddrRange`] are
//!   iterators that generate IP addresses. These can be created using
//!   their constructors. They are also returned by the [`hosts()`]
//!   methods.
//! * The [`IpAdd`], [`IpSub`], [`IpBitAnd`], [`IpBitOr`] traits extend
//!   the [`Ipv4Addr`] and [`Ipv6Addr`] types with methods to perform
//!   these operations.

//! # Serde support
//!
//! This library comes with support for [serde](https://serde.rs) but
//! it's not enabled by default. Use the `serde` [feature] to enable.
//! 
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! ipnet = { version = "2", features = ["serde"] }
//! ```
//!
//! For human readable formats (e.g. JSON) the `IpNet`, `Ipv4Net`, and
//! `Ipv6Net` types will serialize to their `Display` strings.
//! 
//! For compact binary formats (e.g. Bincode) the `Ipv4Net` and
//! `Ipv6Net` types will serialize to a string of 5 and 17 bytes that
//! consist of the network address octects followed by the prefix
//! length. The `IpNet` type will serialize to an Enum with the V4 or V6
//! variant index prepending the above string of 5 or 17 bytes.
