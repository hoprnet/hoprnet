//! Provides form definitions.
//!
//! The forms provided here are used to generically communicate the mode a type
//! identifier, type definition or structure is using.
//!
//! The default form is the `MetaForm`.
//! It uses `MetaType` for communicating type identifiers and thus acts as
//! a bridge from runtime to compile time type information.
//!
//! The `PortableForm` is a space-efficient representation
//! that no longer has any connections to the interning registry and thus
//! can no longer be used to retrieve information from the
//! original registry. Its sole purpose is for space-efficient serialization.
//!
//! Other forms, such as a portable form that is still bound to the registry
//! (also via lifetime tracking) are possible but current not needed.
