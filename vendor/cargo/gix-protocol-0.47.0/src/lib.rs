//! An abstraction over [fetching][fetch()] a pack from the server.
//!
//! Generally, there is the following order of operations.
//!
//! * create a [`Transport`](gix_transport::client::Transport)
//! * perform a [`handshake()`]
//! * execute a [`Command`]
//!     - [list references](ls_refs())
//!          - create a mapping between [refspecs and references](fetch::RefMap)
//!     - [receive a pack](fetch())
//!
