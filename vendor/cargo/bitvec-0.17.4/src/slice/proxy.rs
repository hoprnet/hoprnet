/*! Heavy bit reference.

Regrettably, while producing a read reference to a bit inside a `BitSlice` is
relatively easy to do, Rustâ€™s rules make it impossible to produce a write
reference to one. This is because references must be addresses that the holder
can derefence without type consideration. Read references inspect the `BitSlice`
data sequence, and then produce references to static `true` and `false` values
as appropriate; the returned address does not need to be actually within the
referent memory region.

A write reference, however, is required to be the address of a `bool` within the
`BitSlice`, which can have `0u8` or `1u8` written into it. This rule makes
production of any `&mut bool` from any `&mut BitSlice` impossible. Instead, the
`BitMut` structure serves as a heavy-weight referential object, that cannot be
used in the `&mut` write reference system, as a good-enough substitute.

/** Proxy referential type, equivalent to `&mut bool`.

This structure is three words wide, and cannot ever fit into the existing Rust
language and library infrastructure in the way `&BitSlice` does. While `&mut`
write references are themselves an affine type, with a guaranteed single point
of destruction and no duplication, the language forbids writing finalization
logic for them.

This means that a custom reference type which implements `Deref` and `DerefMut`
to a location within the canonical handle, and on `Drop` writes the `Deref`
location into referent memory, is impossible. Short of that, a C++-style thick
reference-like type is as close as Rust will allow.
