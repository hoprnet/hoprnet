## Installation

Install OpenSSL - 
- Ubuntu - ``` sudo apt install libssl-dev ```
- Fedora - ``` sudo dnf install openssl-devel ```

Make sure your rust is up to date using: 
``` rustup update ```

With [cargo add](https://github.com/killercup/cargo-edit#Installation) installed :
```sh
$ cargo add surf
```

## Safety

This crate makes use of a single instance of `unsafe` in order to make the WASM
backend work despite the `Send` bounds. This is safe because WASM targets
currently have no access to threads. Once they do we'll be able to drop this
implementation, and use a parked thread instead and move to full multi-threading
in the process too.
