```rust
let (tx, rx) = flume::unbounded();

thread::spawn(move || (0..10).for_each(|i| { tx.send(i); }));

let received = rx
    .iter()
    .sum();

assert_eq!((0..10).sum(), received);
```

## Why Flume?

- **Featureful**: Unbounded, bounded and rendezvous queues
- **Fast**: Always faster than `std::sync::mpsc` and sometimes `crossbeam-channel`
- **Safe**: No `unsafe` code anywhere in the codebase!
- **Flexible**: `Sender` and `Receiver` both implement `Send + Sync + Clone`
- **Familiar**: Drop-in replacement for `std::sync::mpsc`
- **Capable**: Additional features like MPMC support and send timeouts/deadlines
- **Simple**: Few dependencies, minimal codebase, fast to compile
- **Asynchronous**: `async` support, including mix 'n match with sync code
- **Ergonomic**: Powerful `select`-like interface

## Usage

To use Flume, place the following line under the `[dependencies]` section in your `Cargo.toml`:

```
flume = "x.y"
```

## [Benchmarks](https://what-if.xkcd.com/147/)

Although Flume has its own extensive benchmarks, don't take it from here that Flume is quick.
The following graph is from the `crossbeam-channel` benchmark suite.
