# Termios Rust Bindings

The `termios` crate provides safe bindings for the Rust programming language to the [terminal I/O
interface](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/basedefs/termios.h.html) implemented by
Unix operating systems. The safe bindings are a small wrapper around the raw C functions, which
converts integer return values to `std::io::Result` to indicate success or failure.

## Project Status

This is a very low-maintenance project. The termios API is decades old. This isn't an area that you
should expect to see daily commits, so don't be put off if you don't see commits for several years.
This just means that the project is stable. That's a good thing. :)

If, however, you see old patches that you'd like to see land, please see
[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) to see how you can help.

## Dependencies & Compatibility

In order to use the `termios` crate, you must have a native `libc` library that implements the
termios API. This should be available on any Unix operating system. This library contains the
termios definitions for the following platforms:

* Linux (x86_64, armv6l)
* Android (x86)
* OS X (x86_64)
* FreeBSD (amd64)
* OpenBSD (amd64)
* NetBSD (amd64)
* DragonFly BSD (x86_64)
* illumos (x86_64)

If you're interested in a platform that's not listed here, please see
[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) to see how you can help.

## Usage

Add `termios` as a dependency in `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
termios = "0.3"
```

Import the `termios` crate and any symbols needed from `termios`. You may also need
`std::os::unix::io::RawFd` for file descriptors and `std::io::Result` to propagate errors.

```rust
extern crate termios;

use std::io;
use std::os::unix::io::RawFd;

use termios::*;

fn setup_fd(fd: RawFd) -> io::Result<()> {
  let mut termios = try!(Termios::from_fd(fd));

  termios.c_iflag = IGNPAR | IGNBRK;
  termios.c_oflag = 0;
  termios.c_cflag = CS8 | CREAD | CLOCAL;
  termios.c_lflag = 0;

  try!(cfsetspeed(&mut termios, B9600));
  try!(tcsetattr(fd, TCSANOW, &termios));
  try!(tcflush(fd, TCIOFLUSH));

  Ok(())
}
```
