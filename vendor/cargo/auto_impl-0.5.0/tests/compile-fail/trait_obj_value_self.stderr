error[E0277]: the size for values of type `dyn Trait` cannot be known at compilation time
  --> $DIR/trait_obj_value_self.rs:12:5

12 |     assert_impl::<Box<dyn Trait>>();
   |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ doesn't have a size known at compile-time
   |
   = help: the trait `Sized` is not implemented for `dyn Trait`
note: required because of the requirements on the impl of `Trait` for `Box<dyn Trait>`
  --> $DIR/trait_obj_value_self.rs:4:1

   | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
5  | trait Trait {
   |       ^^^^^
note: required by a bound in `assert_impl`
  --> $DIR/trait_obj_value_self.rs:9:19

9  | fn assert_impl<T: Trait>() {}
   |                   ^^^^^ required by this bound in `assert_impl`
   = note: this error originates in the attribute macro `auto_impl` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
