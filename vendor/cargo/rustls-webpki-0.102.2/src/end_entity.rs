/// An end-entity certificate.
///
/// Server certificate processing in a TLS connection consists of several
/// steps. All of these steps are necessary:
///
/// * `EndEntityCert.verify_is_valid_tls_server_cert`: Verify that the server's
///   certificate is currently valid *for use by a TLS server*.
/// * `EndEntityCert.verify_is_valid_for_subject_name`: Verify that the server's
///   certificate is valid for the host or IP address that is being connected to.
///
/// * `EndEntityCert.verify_signature`: Verify that the signature of server's
///   `ServerKeyExchange` message is valid for the server's certificate.
///
/// Client certificate processing in a TLS connection consists of analogous
/// steps. All of these steps are necessary:
///
/// * `EndEntityCert.verify_is_valid_tls_client_cert`: Verify that the client's
///   certificate is currently valid *for use by a TLS client*.
/// * `EndEntityCert.verify_signature`: Verify that the client's signature in
///   its `CertificateVerify` message is valid using the public key from the
///   client's certificate.
///
/// Although it would be less error-prone to combine all these steps into a
/// single function call, some significant optimizations are possible if the
/// three steps are processed separately (in parallel). It does not matter much
/// which order the steps are done in, but **all of these steps must completed
/// before application data is sent and before received application data is
/// processed**. `EndEntityCert::from` is an inexpensive operation and is
/// deterministic, so if these tasks are done in multiple threads, it is
/// probably best to just call `EndEntityCert::from` multiple times (before each
/// operation) for the same DER-encoded ASN.1 certificate bytes.
