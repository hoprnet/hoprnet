2.1.4
=====

* Fix crates.io tags. No interesting changes.

2.1.3
=====

Export `PersistError`.

2.1.2
=====

Add `Read`/`Write`/`Seek` impls on `&NamedTempFile`. This mirrors the
implementations on `&File`. One can currently just deref to a `&File` but these
implementations are more discoverable.

2.1.1
=====

Add LFS Support.

2.1.0
=====

* Implement `AsRef<File>` for `NamedTempFile` allowing named temporary files to
  be borrowed as `File`s.
* Add a method to convert a `NamedTempFile` to an unnamed temporary `File`. 

2.0.1
=====

* Arm bugfix

2.0.0
=====

This release replaces `TempFile` with a `tempfile()` function that returnes
`std::fs::File` objects. These are significantly more useful because most rust
libraries expect normal `File` objects.

To continue supporting shared temporary files, this new version adds a
`reopen()` method to `NamedTempFile`.
