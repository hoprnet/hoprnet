0.6.1 (2018-06-08)
==================

Added missing typedefs for mapped lock guards:

- `MappedMutexGuard`
- `MappedReentrantMutexGuard`
- `MappedRwLockReadGuard`
- `MappedRwLockWriteGuard`

0.6.0 (2018-06-08)
==================

This release moves most of the code for type-safe `Mutex` and `RwLock` types
into a separate crate called `lock_api`. This new crate is compatible with
`no_std` and provides `Mutex` and `RwLock` type-safe wrapper types from a
raw mutex type which implements the `RawMutex` or `RawRwLock` trait. The API
provided by the wrapper types can be extended by implementing more traits on the
raw mutex type which provide more functionality (e.g. `RawMutexTimed`). See the
crate documentation for more details.

There are also several major changes:

- The minimum required Rust version is bumped to 1.26.
- All methods on `MutexGuard` (and other guard types) are no longer inherent
  methods and must be called as `MutexGuard::method(self)`. This avoids
  conflicts with methods from the inner type.
- `MutexGuard` (and other guard types) add the `unlocked` method which
  temporarily unlocks a mutex, runs the given closure, and then re-locks the
   mutex.
- `MutexGuard` (and other guard types) add the `bump` method which gives a
  chance for other threads to acquire the mutex by temporarily unlocking it and
  re-locking it. However this is optimized for the common case where there are
  no threads waiting on the lock, in which case no unlocking is performed.
- `MutexGuard` (and other guard types) add the `map` method which returns a
  `MappedMutexGuard` which holds only a subset of the original locked type. The
  `MappedMutexGuard` type is identical to `MutexGuard` except that it does not
  support the `unlocked` and `bump` methods, and can't be used with `CondVar`.
