# If you are reading this file be aware that the original Cargo.toml
# will likely look very different (and much more reasonable).

A Rust implementation of a TAR file reader and writer. This library does not
currently handle compression, but it is abstract over all I/O readers and
writers. Additionally, great lengths are taken to ensure that the entire
contents are never required to be entirely resident in memory all at once.
