## Internet Gateway Device client

This is a simple library that communicates with an UPNP enabled gateway device (a router). Contributions and feedback are welcome.
At the moment, you can search for the gateway, request the gateway's external address and, add/remove port mappings. See the `examples/` folder for a demo.

Contributions are welcome! This is pretty delicate to test, please submit an issue if you have trouble using this.
