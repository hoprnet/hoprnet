//! Low-level implementation details for libc-like runtime libraries such as
//! [origin].
//!
//! These functions are for implementing thread-local storage (TLS), managing
//! threads, loaded libraries, and other process-wide resources. Most of
//! `rustix` doesn't care about what other libraries are linked into the
//! program or what they're doing, but the features in this module generally
//! can only be used by one entity within a process.
//!
//! The API for these functions is not stable, and this module is
//! `doc(hidden)`.
//!
//! [origin]: https://github.com/sunfishcode/mustang/tree/main/origin
//!
//! # Safety
//!
//! This module is intended to be used for implementing a runtime library such
//! as libc. Use of these features for any other purpose is likely to create
//! serious problems.

/// Unlike its POSIX and libc counterparts, this `fork` does not invoke any

///
/// The program environment in the child after a `fork` and before an `execve`
/// is very special. All code that executes in this environment must avoid:
///
///  - Acquiring any other locks that are held in other threads on the parent
///    at the time of the `fork`, as the child only contains one thread, and
///    attempting to acquire such locks will deadlock (though this is [not
///    considered unsafe]).
///
///  - Performing any dynamic allocation using the global allocator, since
///    global allocators may use locks to ensure thread safety, and their locks
///    may not be released in the child process, so attempts to allocate may
///    deadlock (as described in the previous point).
///
///  - Accessing any external state which the parent assumes it has exclusive
///    access to, such as a file protected by a file lock, as this could
///    corrupt the external state.
///
///  - Accessing any random-number-generator state inherited from the parent,
///    as the parent may have the same state and generate the same random
///    numbers, which may violate security invariants.
///
///  - Accessing any thread runtime state, since this function does not update
///    the thread id in the thread runtime, so thread runtime functions could
///    cause undefined behavior.
///
///  - Accessing any memory shared with the parent, such as a [`MAP_SHARED`]
///    mapping, even with anonymous or [`memfd_create`] mappings, as this could
///    cause undefined behavior.
///
///  - Calling any C function which isn't known to be [async-signal-safe], as
///    that could cause undefined behavior. The extent to which this also
///    applies to Rust functions is unclear at this time.
///
/// # Safety
///
/// The child must avoid accessing any memory shared with the parent in a

/// runtime functions in a way that invokes undefined behavior. And it must

/// guaranteed to be async-signal-safe.
