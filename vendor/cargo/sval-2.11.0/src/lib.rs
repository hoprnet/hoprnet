/*!
Structured, streaming values.

`sval` is a serialization framework that treats data as a flat stream of tokens.
The source of that data could be some Rust object or parsed from some encoding.
It's well suited to self-describing, text-based formats like JSON.

# A note on docs

Even though this library's API is stable, these docs themselves are still a
work-in-progress.

# Getting started

Add `sval` to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies.sval]
version = "2.11.0"
```

By default, `sval` doesn't depend on Rust's standard library or integrate
with its collection types. To include them, add the `alloc` or `std` features:

```toml
[dependencies.sval]
version = "2.11.0"
features = ["std"]
```

# The `Value` trait

[`Value`] is a trait for data types to implement that surfaces their structure
through visitors called _streams_. `Value` is like `serde`'s `Serialize`. It
can also be used like `serde`'s `Deserialize`.

Many standard types in Rust implement the `Value` trait. It can be derived
on your own types using the `sval_derive` library.

# The `Stream` trait

[`Stream`] is a trait for data formats and visitors to implement that observes
the structure of _values_. `Stream` is like `serde`'s `Serializer`. It can
also be used like `serde`'s `Deserializer`.

# Data-model

`sval`'s data-model is defined by the [`Stream`] trait. It includes:

- Null
- Booleans (`true`, `false`)
- Text blobs
- Binary blobs
- Integers (`u8`-`u128`, `i8`-`i128`)
- Binary floating points (`f32`-`f64`)
- Maps
- Sequences
- Records
- Tuples
- Enums
- Tags

# Tags

[`Tag`] is a type for extending `sval`'s data-model with new kinds of values.
Rust's own `()` and `Option<T>` types are expressed as tags. Other examples of
tags include text that encodes RFC3339 timestamps or RFC4122 UUIDs.

The [`tags`] module contains built-in tags. Other libraries may define their own tags too.

# Buffering

Complex or arbitrarily-sized values like strings, maps, and sequences can all be
streamed as chunks across multiple calls to avoid intermediate buffering when it's not necessary.

# Object safety

The [`Value`] and [`Stream`] traits aren't object-safe themselves, but object-safe
wrappers are provided by the `sval_dynamic` crate. This wrapper works in no-std.
