## MSRV
WhoAmI 1.x.y targets Rust 1.40.0 stable and later, and the 1.x.y track will
be maintained at least until the release of the Rust 2024 edition.

The MSRV will not be updated until version 2.0.0, after which breaking changes
may happen on minor releases, and version 2.0.0 will target Rust 1.65.0 and
later to make use of the `let else` syntax.  The current plan is for all 2.x
releases to be supported and receive bugfixes at least until sometime in 2027,
bumping MSRV only as needed.

## Binary
[whome](https://crates.io/crates/whome): `whoami` command RiR (Re-written in
Rust) that depends on this crate.

## Testing
The testing procedure is documented at
<https://github.com/ardaku/whoami/blob/v1/TESTING.md>.  The full manual test
suite is run for each change that affects multiple platforms.
