// TODO: docs need updating
//! # core-packet
//!
//! This crate contains the main packet processing functionality for the HOPR protocol.
//! It implements the following important protocol building blocks:
//!
//! - SPHINX packet format (module `packet`)
//! - Proof of Relay (module `por`)
//!
//! and namely it also implements (module `interactions`):
//!
//! - AcknowledgementInteraction
//! - PacketInteraction
//!
//! which are the most important high-level building blocks of the protocol.
//!
//! Finally, it also implements a utility function which is used to validate tickets (module `validation`).
//!
//! All the functionalities are heavily dependent on `core-ethereum-db` crate.
//!
//! The currently used implementation is selected using the `CurrentSphinxSuite` type in the `packet` module.
//!
//! The implementation can be easily extended for different elliptic curves (or even arithmetic multiplicative groups).
//! In particular, as soon as there's way to represent `Ed448` PeerIDs, it would be easy to create e.g. `X448Suite`.
//!
//! ## Interactions
//!
//! - AcknowledgementInteraction
//! - PacketInteraction
//!
//! These types internally work using 2 queues (TX, RX). As soon as acknowledgement or packet is received from the transport layer, it can be enqueued to the RX queue (`received_packet` or `received_acknowledgement`).
//! Similarly, a packet or acknowledgement can be enqueued for sending (via `send_packet` or `send_acknowledgement`).
//!
//! Both TX and RX queues are bounded (currently capped to 2048 entries for both queues and interactions) and en-queuing can be done in either `wait`-mode or `fail-fast` mode if either queue is full. In fail-fast mode, the caller can decide whether to keep trying (e.g. when sending a packet) or whether to discard the data (e.g. when receiving packets).
//!
//! The processing of RX queues can be done by awaiting `handle_outgoing_packets`, `handle_outgoing_acknowledgements` or `handle_incoming_packets` and `handle_incoming_acknowledgements`.
