//! The crate provides the probing functionality used by the transport layer
//! to identify different attributes of possible transport paths in the network.
//!
//! The goal of probing is to establish a map with weighted properties that will
//! allow the caller to optimize transport, verify transport path properties and
//! lay groundworks for mitigating potential adversarial behavior.
//!
//! There are 2 fundamental types of probing:
//! 1. Immediate hop probing - collects telemetry for direct 0-hop neighbors. Such telemetry can be identified and
//!    potentially gamed by an adversary, but it is still useful to identify the basic properties of the most immediate
//!    connection to the neighbor, since in the worst case scenario the mitigation strategy can discard unsuitable
//!    peers.
//!
//! 2. Multi-hop probing - collects telemetry using a probing mechanism based on looping. A loop is a message sent by
//!    this peer to itself through different pre-selected peers. This probing mechanism can be combined together with
//!    the cover traffic into a single mechanism improving the network view.
