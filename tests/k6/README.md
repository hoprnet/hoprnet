# Load Testing

This package is responsible of creating a set of load testing scenarios to be used to check performance and capacity of Hoprd network

##Â Use cases

- Generate high peaks of load to test network stability at those circumstances
- Generate high peaks of load to test hoprd node stability at those circumstances
- Generate cover traffic on nodes while there is a better cover traffic approach implemented within the hoprd node
- Generate constant traffic on nodes to test the network and their nodes against long running periods

# Setup development environment

Here are the most useful commands:

- `yarn install`: Install dependencies
- `npm run build`: Build source code
- `npm run cluster:start`: Start local cluster
- `npm run test`: Execute constant traffic test locally
- `npm run cluster:stop`: Stops the local cluster
- `npm run admin:start`: Starts the Admin UI container
- `npm run admin:stop`: Stops the Admin UI container
