//! Contains implementation of a `Session` message protocol.
//!
//! # What is `Session` protocol?
//! `Session` protocol is a simple protocol for unreliable networks that implements
//! basic TCP-like features, such as segmentation, retransmission and acknowledgement.
//!
//! The goal of this protocol is to establish a read-write session between two parties,
//! where one is a message sender and the other one is the receiver. The messages are called
//! *frames* which are split and are delivered as *segments* from the sender to the recipient.
//! The session has some reliability guarantees given by the retransmission and acknowledgement
//! capabilities of individual segments.
//!
//! # Overview of the module
//! - Protocol messages are defined in the [`protocol`] submodule.
//! - Protocol state machine is defined in the [`state`] submodule.
//! - Frames, segmentation and reassembly are defined in the `frame` submodule.
//!

//! Contains errors thrown from this module.
