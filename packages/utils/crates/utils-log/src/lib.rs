//! This package wraps the basic functionality of logging for a hybrid WASM/Rust
//! environment. It properly encapsulates the logging facilities and uses correct
//! logging macros based on the feature turned on.
//!
//! ## WASM environment
//! Turned on by enabling the feature `wasm`.
//!
//! The crate wraps a `console.log` log message from the JavaScript environment for
//! a WASM enabled environment.
//!
//! With a `feature = "wasm"` on but under a `cfg(test)` it uses the native Rust
//! `log` crate to register the log messages. This allows turning the logging on
//! and off in the tests for easier debugging.
//! - if debugging in a crate using utils_log is necessary, the `dev-dependencies`
//! of that crate should be extended with `env_logger = "0.10.0"`
//! - the test to be debugged must contain this line as the first line of the test:
//! `let _ = env_logger::init();`
//!
//! ## Non-WASM environment
//! With the `wasm` feature not turned on the macros from the `log` crate are used.
