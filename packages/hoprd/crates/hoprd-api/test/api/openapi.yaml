        This is a websocket endpoint which exposes a subset of message functions.
        Incoming messages from other nodes are sent to the websocket client.
        A client may also send message by sending the following data:
          { cmd: "sendmsg", args: { peerId: "SOME_PEER_ID", path: [], hops: 1} }
        The command arguments follow the same semantics as in the dedicated API endpoint for sending messages.

        The following messages may be sent by the server over the Websocket connection:

          {
            type: "message",
            tag: 12,
            body: "my example message"
          }

          {
            type: "message-ack",
            id: "some challenge id"
          }

          {
            type: "message-ack-challenge",
            id: "some challenge id"
          }
         Authentication (if enabled) is done via either passing an `apiToken` parameter in the url or cookie `X-Auth-Token`. Connect to the endpoint by using a WS client. No preview available. Example: `ws://127.0.0.1:3001/api/v2/messages/websocket/?apiToken=myApiToken`
