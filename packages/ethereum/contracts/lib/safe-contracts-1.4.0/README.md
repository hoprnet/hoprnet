Usage
-----
### Install requirements with yarn:

```bash
yarn
```

### Run all tests:

```bash
yarn build
yarn test
```

### Deployments

A collection of the different Safe contract deployments and their addresses can be found in the [Safe deployments](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-deployments) repository.

To add support for a new network follow the steps of the ``Deploy`` section and create a PR in the [Safe deployments](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-deployments) repository. 

### Deploy

> :warning: **Make sure to use the correct commit when deploying the contracts.** Any change (even comments) within the contract files will result in different addresses. The tagged versions that are used by the Safe team can be found in the [releases](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-contracts/releases).

> **Current version:** The latest release is [v1.3.0-libs.0](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-contracts/tree/v1.3.0-libs.0) on the commit [767ef36](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-contracts/commit/767ef36bba88bdbc0c9fe3708a4290cabef4c376)

This will deploy the contracts deterministically and verify the contracts on etherscan using [Solidity 0.7.6](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.7.6) by default.

Preparation:
- Set `MNEMONIC` in `.env`
- Set `INFURA_KEY` in `.env`

```bash
yarn deploy-all <network>
```

This will perform the following steps

```bash
yarn build
yarn hardhat --network <network> deploy
yarn hardhat --network <network> sourcify
yarn hardhat --network <network> etherscan-verify
yarn hardhat --network <network> local-verify
```

#### Custom Networks

It is possible to use the `NODE_URL` env var to connect to any EVM based network via an RPC endpoint. This connection then can be used with the `custom` network.

E.g. to deploy the Safe contract suite on that network you would run `yarn deploy-all custom`. 

The resulting addresses should be on all networks the same.

Note: Address will vary if contract code is changed or a different Solidity version is used.

#### Replay protection (EIP-155)

Some networks require replay protection, making it incompatible with the default deployment process as it relies on a presigned transaction without replay protection (see https://github.com/Arachnid/deterministic-deployment-proxy). 

Safe contracts use a different deterministic deployment proxy (https://github.com/safe-global/safe-singleton-factory). To make sure that the latest version of this package is installed, make sure to run `yarn add @gnosis.pm/safe-singleton-factory` before deployment. For more information, including how to deploy the factory to a new network, please refer to the factory repo.  

Note: This will result in different addresses compared to hardhat's default deterministic deployment process.

### Verify contract

This command will use the deployment artifacts to compile the contracts and compare them to the onchain code
```bash
yarn hardhat --network <network> local-verify
```

This command will upload the contract source to Etherescan
```bash
yarn hardhat --network <network> etherscan-verify
```
