## [0.2.23](https://github.com/hoprnet/hopr-connect/compare/v0.2.21...v0.2.23) (2021-03-01)

### Fixes

- close relayed connections if counterparty is not reachable

### Breaking changes

- Subnet detection: Nodes are able to detect whether the dialed address is a private address which is not in their reachable subnets.
- Nodes do not consider link-locale IP addresses as dialable

#### Addressing

Before `hopr-connect@0.2.22` the follwoing addresses were valid

- `Multiaddr("/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/0/p2p/16Uiu2HAmCPgzWWQWNAn2E3UXx1G3CMzxbPfLr1SFzKqnFjDcbdwg")`
- `Multiaddr("/p2p/16Uiu2HAmCPgzWWQWNAn2E3UXx1G3CMzxbPfLr1SFzKqnFjDcbdwg")`

Since `hopr-connect@0.2.22`, nodes need to explicitly name the relay behind which they are accessible

- `Multiaddr("/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/0/p2p/16Uiu2HAmCPgzWWQWNAn2E3UXx1G3CMzxbPfLr1SFzKqnFjDcbdwg")`
- `Multiaddr("/p2p/16Uiu2HAkyvdVZtG8btak5SLrxP31npfJo6maopj8xwx5XQhKfspb/p2p-circuit/p2p/16Uiu2HAmCPgzWWQWNAn2E3UXx1G3CMzxbPfLr1SFzKqnFjDcbdwg")`

Nodes will automatically dial given bootstrap addresses and check whether they can reach them and announce them ordered by latency to other nodes.

#### Default export to named export

Before `hopr-connect@0.2.23`, the main class HoprConnect was a default export, since `hopr-connect@0.2.23` it is a named export.

## [0.2.10](https://github.com/hoprnet/hopr-connect/compare/0.2.8...0.2.10) (2021-01-28)

### Breaking changes

#### Addressing

Before `hopr-connect@0.2.10`, the following addresses were valid:

- `Multiaddr("/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/0")`
- `Multiaddr("/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/0/p2p/16Uiu2HAmCPgzWWQWNAn2E3UXx1G3CMzxbPfLr1SFzKqnFjDcbdwg")`
- `Multiaddr("/p2p/16Uiu2HAmCPgzWWQWNAn2E3UXx1G3CMzxbPfLr1SFzKqnFjDcbdwg")`

Since `hopr-connect@0.2.10`, only addresses that include a PeerId are considered valid, namely:

- `Multiaddr("/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/0/p2p/16Uiu2HAmCPgzWWQWNAn2E3UXx1G3CMzxbPfLr1SFzKqnFjDcbdwg")`
- `Multiaddr("/p2p/16Uiu2HAmCPgzWWQWNAn2E3UXx1G3CMzxbPfLr1SFzKqnFjDcbdwg")`
