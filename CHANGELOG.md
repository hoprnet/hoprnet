# Breaking changes

Due to the configuration changes (refer to #2778), transport packets are now properly encapsulated between environments/releases.
Thus, existing nodes won't be able to communicate to new nodes.

### Changes

- Added git hash in `hopr-admin` page ([#2869](https://github.com/hoprnet/hoprnet/pull/2869))
- Remove legacy bi-directional channels code ([#2765](https://github.com/hoprnet/hoprnet/pull/2765))
- Use environments as central configuration for hoprd releases ([#2778](https://github.com/hoprnet/hoprnet/pull/2778))
