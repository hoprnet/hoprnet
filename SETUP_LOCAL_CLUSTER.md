# Introduction

The best way to learn and develop the HOPR protocol is by interacting with a HOPR node connected inside the HOPR network. A series of HOPR nodes interconnected (i.e. reachable and with channels opened against each other) is called a HOPR cluster.

Although the HOPR Association provides a [production HOPR cluster](https://status.hoprnet.org/) anyone could talk to in production[^1],
this setup is not ideal for development as doing so would incur on costs for executing basic operations. Staging networks
such as g√∂rli are too slow to provide meaningful feedback, so the ideal setup for properly interacting with the HOPR
ecosystem toolset is running a local HOPR cluster, either in your workstation or via a cloud environment like
[Gitpod](https://gitpod.io). This way contributors are not constrained by internet connection or blockchain RPC providers.

# Tooling

As of the time of writing, the best way to set up a local HOPR cluster is by following these steps[^2]. Please bear in mind that these steps
had been tested only on `Darwin` and `Linux` devices, for Windows please use our cloud setup instead.

1. **Download the latest version of the repository**: Download a local version of our [GitHub repository monorepo](https://github.com/hoprnet/hoprnet)[^3]
   and unzip it in your local folder and enter the unzipped directory.

```
wget https://github.com/hoprnet/hoprnet/archive/refs/heads/master.zip
unzip master.zip
cd hoprnet-master
```

1. **Install the dependencies of the project and build it**:

```
make -j deps && make -j build
```

2. **Run the one-line setup script**: Proceed to run the following script.

```
./scripts/ -i topologies/full_interconnected_cluster.sh
```

**Important**, make sure to have both `curl` and `jq` installed in your computer before running the script, as both are used.
Please be aware you also need a version of `bash` of `5.x` or superior, which in most macOS devices require an upgrade, the easiest being via `brew bash`.

Afterwards, a set off accounts with their respective HTTP REST API, HOPR Admin, and WebSocket interface will be displayed
in your screen. If this is your first time using HOPR, I suggest navigating to the `HOPR Admin` URL to get familiar with
the basic commands. Afterwards, it might also make sense to check the API v2 Swagger URL.

[^1]:
    Production is to be understood as a "live" network where [HOPR](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/hopr/) tokens can
    be exchanged or used as means to power its network `HoprChannels.sol` smart contract. As of time of writing, the only live
    network is the [Gnosis Chain](https://www.xdaichain.com/) (previously known as xDai Chain), with the only available publicly
    traded utility token being [`wxHOPR`](https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/token/0xD4fdec44DB9D44B8f2b6d529620f9C0C7066A2c1/token-transfers).

    Tasks [#167](https://github.com/hoprnet/hopr-devrel/issues/167), [#168](https://github.com/hoprnet/hopr-devrel/issues/168),
    and [#169](https://github.com/hoprnet/hopr-devrel/issues/167) are alternatives to the current setup. Whenever these tasks are
    completed, these instructions will be updated in [#170](https://github.com/hoprnet/hopr-devrel/issues/170).

[^3]:
    By using the `master` tag, you are downloading the latest version of `hoprnet` to spin up your nodes, which might be ideal
    to your particular use case. However, due to the rapid development done on the project, you might be better off using a stable
    release, found on the [`Release` page](https://github.com/hoprnet/hoprnet/releases).
