# Documentation of our usage of Rust & WASM

This file documents how we're using our Rust toolchain to build WASM compatible crates that are used in
our monorepo.

It is also meant as place that can contain various tips that make development of WASM-compatible creates easier,
including tips related to `wasm-bindgen`.

## Structure

All our packages contain the `crates` directory, that is meant to contain the Rust crates.
E.g. the `utils` package looks as follows:

```text
utils
    ├── crates
    │   ├── Makefile
    │   ├── utils-metrics
    │   │   ├── Cargo.toml
    │   │   ├── README.md
    │   │   ├── src
    │   │   │   ├── lib.rs
    │   │   │   └── metrics.rs
    │   │   └── tests
    │   │       └── wasm.rs
    │   └── utils-misc
    │       ├── Cargo.toml
    │       ├── src
    │       │   ├── lib.rs
    │       │   └── utils.rs
    │       └── tests
    │           └── node.rs

```

Each crate is prefixed using the name of the package, therefore the crate names are

- `utils-metrics`
- `utils-misc`

In addition, all Rust crates across all packages must be enumerated in `Cargo.toml` in the root of the Monorepo:

```toml
[workspace]

members = [
    "packages/real/crates/real-base",
    "packages/hoprd/crates/hoprd-misc",
    "packages/utils/crates/utils-misc",
    "packages/utils/crates/utils-metrics"
]

# ... etc.
```

The `Makefile` which is present in `crates` directory of each package takes care of building and testing the
crates for that respective package. The crates in a package must be enumerated on the first line of the respective `Makefile`.
e.g. in `utils` crate:

```makefile
# Append here when new Rust WASM crate is added (the list is space separated)
PACKAGES = utils-misc utils-metrics
##########################################

# ... etc.
```

The `Makefile` supports basic actions:

- `clean`
- `all`
- `install`
- `test`

### Testing

The unit tests are meant to be in the same module file, for each Rust module.
They are pure-Rust and are easy to debug with IDE.

The integration tests, that run in WASM runtime are currently not possible to be debugged
and are located in the `test` directory of a crate.

## Adding a new crate

To add a new Rust WASM module (crate) into an existing package:

1. `cd packages/<package>/crates`
2. `wasm-pack new my-crate --template https://github.com/hoprnet/hopr-wasm-template`, this will create a new Rust crate `my-crate` from a template.
3. remove the cloned Git repo: `rm -rf my-crate/.git`
4. add `my-crate` to `PACKAGES` space separated list in `Makefile`
5. add `my-crate` to `workspace.members` in `Cargo.toml` in the root of the Monorepo
6. run `make all && make install` for the first time
7. commit all changes: `git add my-crate && git commit -a`

You can use the following pattern in TS to export Rust types or functions:

```typescript
// Load `my-crate` crate
import { set_panic_hook as my_crate_panic_hook } from '../lib/my_crate.js'
my_crate_panic_hook()
export { foo } from '../lib/my_crate.js'
```

Note, that the panic hook needs to be installed for each crate separately (each crate run in separate execution environment).

Triggering the build of the entire monorepo (`make deps build`) should now also build
and integrate your new Rust crate. Similarly `make test` in the root of the monorepo
will trigger your Rust unit tests and WASM integration tests.

## Guidelines and tips

### To make something visible to WASM

Use `#[cfg_attr(feature = "wasm", wasm_bindgen::prelude::wasm_bindgen)]` attribute on it (a function, type or `impl` block).
The attribute makes sure, that when the `wasm` feature is enabled in Cargo, it will be available to BOTH WASM and non-WASM (pure Rust),
therefore you MUST use only types which are compatible with BOTH. Avoid using WASM-incompatible types and WASM-specific types.

### Something available only to pure Rust

Do not use any attribute. Types NOT compatible with WASM can be used freely.

- trait implementations & generic types are NOT supported by `wasm-bindgen` and therefore they can be used only in pure Rust.

### Something available only to WASM

Put it inside the `wasm` submodule. The code in that module is built only when the `wasm` feature is enabled in Cargo,
and does not interfere with your pure Rust code (unless you intentionally `use` that module).
You can use WASM-specific types freely.

## Avoid WASM-specific imports outside `wasm` submodule

Any WASM imports (such as `js_sys`,...etc.) ARE WASM-specific (obviously), and must be used strictly inside
the `wasm` submodule. This makes sure our code is buildable with the `wasm` Cargo feature turned on/off.

The following example shows our some guidelines how to properly implement WASM and non-WASM types and their definitions:

```rust
// This type will be made available to both WASM (when the "wasm" feature is turned on)
// and non-WASM (pure Rust)
#[cfg_attr(feature = "wasm", wasm_bindgen::prelude::wasm_bindgen)]
pub struct MyStruct {
    foo: u32,        // private members do not need to have WASM-compatible types
    pub bar: u32    // public members MUST have WASM-compatible types, if struct used with #[cfg_attr(feature = "wasm"...
    // NOTE: you can use #[cfg_attr(feature = "wasm", wasm_bindgen::prelude::wasm_bindgen(skip))]
    // on a public attribute that shall not be available to WASM
}

// This function won't be available in WASM, even when the "wasm" feature is on
pub fn foo() -> u32 { 42 }

// This function must not use WASM-specific types, but must be WASM compatible,
// because the attribute makes it available to both WASM and non-WASM (pure Rust)
#[cfg_attr(feature = "wasm", wasm_bindgen::prelude::wasm_bindgen)]
pub fn bar() -> u32 { 0 }

impl MyStruct {
   // Here, specify methods with types that are strictly NOT compatible with WASM (pure Rust)
}

#[cfg_attr(feature = "wasm", wasm_bindgen::prelude::wasm_bindgen)]
impl MyStruct {
   // Here, specify methods with types that are compatible with BOTH WASM and non-WASM (pure Rust)
}

// NOTE: That several `impl` blocks of the same type can co-exist, if there are different attributes on them!

// Trait implementations for types can NEVER be made available for WASM (not currently supported by wasm-bindgen)
impl ToString for ChannelStatus {
    fn to_string(&self) -> String {
        todo!()
    }
}

/// Unit tests of pure Rust code (must not contain anything WASM specific)
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_foo() {
        assert_eq!(42, foo());
    }
}

/// Module for WASM-specific Rust code
#[cfg(feature = "wasm")]
pub mod wasm {

    // Specify free functions here that operate on MyStruct which are stricly WASM-only compatible (e.g. use js_sys,...etc.)
    // Also types and other free functions that are WASM-only specific are defined here

    use wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;
    use wasm_bindgen::JsValue;

    #[wasm_bindgen]
    pub fn foo(_val: JsValue) -> i32 {
        super::foo()
    }
}
```
