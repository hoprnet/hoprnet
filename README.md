## Getting Started

A good place to start is the
[Getting Started guide on YouTube][7] which walks through the following
instructions using GitPod.

## Install

The following instructions show how the latest community release may be
installed. The instructions should be adapted if you want to use the latest
development release or any other older release.

The preferred way of installation should be via Docker.

### Install via Docker

All our docker images can be found in [our Google Cloud Container Registry][4].
Each image is prefixed with `gcr.io/hoprassociation/$PROJECT:$RELEASE`.
The `master-goerli` tag represents the `master` branch, while the `valencia` tag
represents the most recent `release/*` branch.

You can pull the Docker image like so:

```sh
docker pull gcr.io/hoprassociation/hoprd:valencia
```

For ease of use you can set up a shell alias to run the latest release as a docker container:

```sh
alias hoprd='docker run --pull always -ti -v ${HOPRD_DATA_DIR:-$HOME/.hoprd-db}:/app/db -p 9091:9091 -p 3000:3000 -p 3001:3001 gcr.io/hoprassociation/hoprd:valencia'
```

**IMPORTANT:** Using the above command will map the database folder used by hoprd to a local folder called `.hoprd-db` in your home directory. You can customize the location of that folder further by executing the following command:

```sh
HOPRD_DATA_DIR=${HOME}/.hoprd-better-db-folder eval hoprd
```

Also all ports are mapped to your localhost, assuming you stick to the default port numbers.

### Install via NPM

Please make sure you are running a compatible version of Node.js.

```sh
node --version
# v16.15.0
```

To always use the right version of Node.js, we recommend to install [Fast Node.js Manager (fnm)](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) and run `fnm use`.

```sh
fnm use
# Using Node v16.15.0
```

Using the [hoprd npm package][6]:

```sh
mkdir MY_NEW_HOPR_TEST_FOLDER
cd MY_NEW_HOPR_TEST_FOLDER
npm install @hoprnet/hoprd@1.88
```

### Install via [Nix package manager][1]

NOTE: This setup should only be used for development or if you know what you
are doing and don't need further support. Otherwise you should use the `npm`
or `docker` setup.

You will need to clone the `hoprnet` repo first:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/hoprnet/hoprnet
```

If you have [direnv][2] set up properly your `nix-shell` will be
configured automatically upon entering the `hoprnet` directory and enabling it
via `direnv allow`. Otherwise you must enter the `nix-shell` manually:

```sh
nix develop
```

Now you may follow the instructions in [Develop](#develop).

## Using

The `hoprd` provides various command-line switches to configure its behaviour. For reference these are documented here as well:

```sh
$ hoprd --help

All CLI options can be configured through environment variables as well. CLI parameters have precedence over environment variables.
```

As you might have noticed running the node without any command-line argument might not work depending on the installation method used. Here are examples to run a node with some safe configurations set.

### Using Docker

The following command assumes you've setup an alias like described in [Install via Docker](#install-via-docker).

```sh
hoprd --identity /app/hoprd-db/.hopr-identity --password switzerland --init --announce --host "0.0.0.0:9091" --admin --adminHost 0.0.0.0 --apiToken <MY_TOKEN> --environment monte_rosa
```

Here is a short breakdown of each argument.

```sh
hoprd
  --identity /app/hoprd-db/.hopr-identity      # store your node identity information in the persisted database folder
  --password switzerland   	# set the encryption password for your identity
  --init 				    # initialize the database and identity if not present
  --announce 				# announce the node to other nodes in the network and act as relay if publicly reachable
  --host "0.0.0.0:9091"   	# set IP and port of the P2P API to the container's external IP so it can be reached on your host
  --admin   	            # enable the node's admin UI
  --adminHost 0.0.0.0       # set IP of the Rest API to the container's external IP so it can be reached on your host
  --apiToken <MY_TOKEN>     # specify password for accessing admin panel and REST API(REQUIRED)
  --environment monte_rosa # an environment is defined as a chain plus a number of deployed smart contract addresses to use on that chain
                            # each release has a default environment id set, but the user can override this value
                            # nodes from different environments are **not able** to communicate
```

### Using NPM

The following command assumes you've setup a local installation like described in [Install via NPM](#install-via-npm).

```sh
cd MY_NEW_HOPR_TEST_FOLDER
DEBUG=hopr* npx hoprd --admin --init --announce --identity .hopr-identity --password switzerland --apiToken <MY_TOKEN>
```

Here is a short break-down of each argument.

```sh
hoprd
  --admin   	              # enable the node's admin UI, available at localhost:3000
  --init 				      # initialize the database and identity if not present
  --announce 				  # announce the node to other nodes in the network and act as relay if publicly reachable
  --identity .hopr-identity   # store your node identity information in your test folder
  --password switzerland   	  # set the encryption password for your identity
  --apiToken <MY_TOKEN>       # specify password for accessing admin panel and REST API (REQUIRED)
```

## Testnet accessibility

Currently, to be able to participate in a public testnet or public staging environment, you need to satisfy certain criteria to be eligible to join. See [Network Registry](NETWORK_REGISTRY.md) for details.

These criteria however, are not required when you develop using your local nodes or a locally running cluster (see [Develop section below](#develop)).

## Migrating between releases

At the moment we DO NOT HAVE backward compatibility between releases.
We attempt to provide instructions on how to migrate your tokens between releases.

1. Set your automatic channel strategy to `MANUAL`.
2. Redeem all unredeemed tickets.
3. Close all open payment channels.
4. Once all payment channels have closed, withdraw your funds to an external
   wallet.
5. Run `info` and take note of the **network name**.
6. Once funds are confirmed to exist in a different wallet, backup `.hopr-identity` folder.
7. Launch new `HOPRd` instance using latest release, observe the account address.
8. Only transfer funds to new `HOPRd` instance if `HOPRd` operates on the **same network** as last release, you can compare the two networks using `info`.

## Develop

HOPR contains modules written in Rust, therefore a Rust toolchain is needed to successfully build the artifacts.
To install Rust toolchain (at least version 1.60) please follow instructions at [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) first.

```sh
make -j deps && make -j build

# starting network
HOPR_ENVIRONMENT_ID=hardhat-localhost yarn run:network

# workaround for a temp issue with local hardhat-network
cp -R packages/ethereum/deployments/hardhat-localhost/localhost/. packages/ethereum/deployments/hardhat-localhost/hardhat

# running normal node alice (separate terminal)
DEBUG="hopr*" yarn run:hoprd:alice

# running normal node bob (separate terminal)
DEBUG="hopr*" yarn run:hoprd:bob

# fund all your nodes to get started
HOPR_ENVIRONMENT_ID=hardhat-localhost yarn run:faucet:all
```

## Local cluster

The best way to test with multiple HOPR nodes is by using a local cluster of interconnected nodes.
See [how to start your local HOPR cluster](SETUP_LOCAL_CLUSTER.md).

## Test

### Unit testing

We use [mocha][9] for our tests. You can run our test suite across all
packages using the following command:

```sh
make test
```

To run tests of a single package (e.g. hoprd) execute:

```sh
make test package=hoprd
```

To run tests of a single test suite (e.g. Identity) within a
package (e.g. hoprd) execute:

For instance, to run only the `Identity` test suite in `hoprd`, you need to
run the following:

```sh
yarn --cwd packages/hoprd test --grep "Identity"
```

In a similar fashion, our contracts can be tested in isolation. For now, you
need to pass the file to be tested, as [hardhat does not support --grep][12]

```sh
yarn test:contracts test/HoprChannels.spec.ts
```

In case a package you need to test is not included in our `package.json`,
please feel free to update it as needed.

#### Test-driven development

To make sure we add the least amount of untested code to our codebase,
whenever possible all code should come accompanied by a test. To do so,
locate the `.spec` or equivalent test file for your code. If it does not
exist, create it within the same file your code will live in.

Afterwards, ensure you create a breaking test for your feature. For example,
the [following commit][10] added a test to a non-existing feature. The
immediate [commit][11] provided the actual feature for that given test. Repeat
this process for all the code you add to our codebase.

_(The code was pushed as an example, but ideally, you only push code that has
working tests on your machine, as to avoid overusing our CI pipeline with
known broken tests.)_

### Github Actions CI

We run a fair amount of automation using Github Actions. To ease development
of these workflows one can use [act][8] to run workflows locally in a
Docker environment.

E.g. running the build workflow:

```sh
act -j build
```

For more information please refer to [act][8]'s documentation.

### End-to-End Testing

#### Running Tests Locally

End-to-end testing is usually performed by the CI, but can also be performed
locally by executing:

```sh
./scripts/run-integration-tests-source.sh
```

Read the full help information of the script in case of questions:

```sh
./scripts/run-integration-tests-source.sh --help
```

That command will spawn multiple `hoprd` nodes locally from the local
source code and run the tests against this cluster of nodes. The tests can be
found in the files `test/*.sh`. The script will clean up all nodes once completed
unless instructed otherwise.

An alternative to using the local source code is running the tests against
a NPM package.

```sh
./scripts/run-integration-tests-npm.sh
```

If no parameter is given the NPM package which correlates to the most recent Git
tag will be used, otherwise the first parameter is used as the NPM package
version to test.

Read the full help information of the script in case of questions:

```sh
./scripts/run-integration-tests-npm.sh --help
```

#### Running Tests on Google Cloud Platform

In some unique cases, some bugs might not have been picked up by our end-to-end
testing and instead only show up when deployed to production. To avoid having
to see these only after a time-consuming build, a cluster of nodes can be
deployed to Google Cloud Platform which is then used to run tests against it.

A requirement for this setup is a working `gcloud` configuration locally.
The easiest approach would be to authenticate with `gcloud auth login`.

The cluster creation and tests can be run with:

```sh
FUNDING_PRIV_KEY=mysecretaccountprivkey \
  ./scripts/run-integration-tests-gcloud.sh
```

The given account private key is used to fund the test nodes to be able to
perform throughout the tests. Thus the account must have enough funds available.

The test instantiated by this script will also include nodes behind NAT.

Read the full help information of the script in case of questions:

```sh
./scripts/run-integration-tests-gcloud.sh --help
```

## Deploy

The deployment nodes and networks are mostly orchestrated through the script
files in `scripts/` which are executed by the Github Actions CI workflows.
Therefore, all common and minimal networks do not require manual steps to be
deployed.

### Using Google Cloud Platform

However, sometimes it is useful to deploy additional nodes or specific versions
of `hoprd`. To accomplish that its possible to create a cluster on GCP using the
following scripts:

```sh
./scripts/setup-gcloud-cluster.sh my-custom-cluster-without-name
```

Read the full help information of the script in case of questions:

```sh
./scripts/setup-gcloud-cluster.sh --help
```

The script requires a few environment variables to be set, but will inform the
user if one is missing. It will create a cluster of 6 nodes. By default these
nodes will use the latest Docker image of `hoprd` and run on the `Goerli`
network. Different versions and different target networks can be configured
through the parameters and environment variables.

To launch nodes using the `xDai` network one would execute (with the
placeholders replaced accordingly):

```sh
HOPRD_API_TOKEN="<ADMIN_AUTH_HTTP_TOKEN>" \
HOPRD_PASSWORD="<IDENTITY_FILE_PASSWORD>" \
  ./scripts/setup-gcloud-cluster.sh environment "" my-custom-cluster-without-name
```

A previously started cluster can be destroyed, which includes all running nodes,
by using the same script but setting the cleanup switch:

```sh
HOPRD_PERFORM_CLEANUP=true \
  ./scripts/setup-gcloud-cluster.sh environment "" my-custom-cluster-without-name
```

The default Docker image in `scripts/setup-gcloud-cluster.sh` deploys GCloud public nodes. If you wish to deploy GCloud nodes
that are behind NAT, you need to specify a NAT-variant of the `hoprd` image (note the `-nat` suffix in the image name):

```sh
HOPRD_PERFORM_CLEANUP=true \
  ./scripts/setup-gcloud-cluster.sh environment "" my-nat-cluster gcr.io/hoprassociation/hoprd-nat
```

Note that if the Docker image version is not specified, the script will use the `environment` as version.

### Using Google Cloud Platform and a Default Topology

The creation of a `hoprd` cluster on GCP can be enhanced by providing a topology
script to the creation script:

```sh
./scripts/setup-gcloud-cluster.sh \
  my-custom-cluster-without-name \
  gcr.io/hoprassociation/hoprd:valencia \
  `pwd`/scripts/topologies/full_interconnected_cluster.sh
```

After the normal cluster creation the topology script will then open channels
between all nodes so they are fully interconnected. Custom topology scripts can
be easily added and used in the same manner. Refer to the referenced scripts as
a guideline on how to get started.
