This Pull requests contains all the required changes needed before releasing a new version.

- [ ] Check that there is an entry in `releases.json` for the new release name.
   - If the release will run in its own network ($RELEASENAME == $NETWORK) then a new entry in `hopr/hopr-lib/data/protocol-config.json` should be created for the network.
   - If the release will run in a multinetwork network like `dufour` then update the file `hopr/hopr-lib/data/protocol-config.json` for the `dufour` entry to accept the new `version_range` of the new release.
- [ ] Change all occurences of the last release name to the new release name within documentation files and Docker files. Don't touch the `protocol-config.json` and `releases.json` files in this step.
- [ ] Check the [milestone](https://github.com/hoprnet/hoprnet/milestones) contents and that all items are closed. And there is no missing issue or PR to be included.
- [ ] If the release will run in a new network then, check that the entry `networks` in `contracts-addresses.json`, contains its own network

   Changes should be committed locally.

- [ ] Assess that all CI checks have passed successfully and wait for the docker images builds to finish.
