The HOPR Association _tech_ members and [Project Owner](./development.md#legend) have agreed on the following processes to streamline the whole development cycle of HOPR.

2. [Release Process](./release.md)
3. [Community Process](./community.md)
4. [Wallets Process](./wallets.md)
5. [Bounty Process](./bounty.md)

## On Processes

All members may suggest changes to our processes.

1. For questions, reach out to one of the [Representatives](./development.md#representatives) through email, element, or simply asking the question in element channel `tech - pm`.
2. For changes, make a PR modifying this file, the PR will have to be reviewed by the [Trifecta](./development.md#trifecta), the [Process Facilitator](./development.md#legend), and generally be accepted by the _tech_ team.

All members may voice their objections to decisions made by management.

1. First reach out to one of the [Representatives](./development.md#representatives) through email, directly in element, or simply in element channel `tech - pm`.
2. If (1) option doesn't produce satisfatory results, member is free to contact upper management.
