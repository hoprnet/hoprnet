# HOPR Processes

The HOPR Association _tech_ members and [Project Owner](./development.md#legend) have agreed on the following processes to streamline the whole development cycle of HOPR.

1. [Development Process](./development.md)
2. [Release Process](./release.md)
3. [Community Process](./community.md)
4. [Wallets Process](./wallets.md)

## Processes

All members may suggest changes to our processes.

1. For questions, reach out to one of the [Representatives](./development.md#representatives) through email, element, or simply asking the question in element channel `tech - pm`.
2. For changes, make a PR modifying this file, the PR will have to be reviewed by the [Trifecta](./development.md#trifecta), the [Process Facilitator](./development.md#legend), and generally be accepted by the _tech_ team.
