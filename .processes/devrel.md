# DevRel Process

The purpose of this process is to streamline the interaction and resource sharing between HOPR's _tech_ team and other departments at HOPR.

## Community Team

### Allocating tech's resources

Community team is expected to create github issues in [this repository](https://github.com/hoprnet/hopr-devrel).

- should use [RFM](https://github.com/hoprnet/hopr-devrel/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/request-for-minting-hoprboost-nft.md) template for minting NFTs
- should use [Request Tech Work](https://github.com/hoprnet/hopr-devrel/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/request-for-tech-work.md) template for other work
- issues labelled as `high priority` will be treated as a [file-alarm](./development.md#fire-alarm)
- normal issues will be queued for work in next sprint planning
- issues should contain all information the author can provide, even if that means it includes more noise or possibly unrelated data
- tech members are encouraged to ask questions to get more information from the issue author
- issues should be created as early as possible to provide time for scheduling work

Once the issue is created, community team must share the github issue in element channel `community` and tag both [representantives](./development.md#representantives).
