# Community Processes

The HOPR Association _tech_ members, _community_ members and [Project Owner](./development.md#legend) have agreed on the following interaction processes to streamline allocation of _tech_ resources.

## Creating Issues

Community team is expected to create github issues in [this repository](https://github.com/hoprnet/hopr-devrel).

- should use [RFM](https://github.com/hoprnet/hopr-devrel/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/request-for-minting-hoprboost-nft.md) template for minting NFTs
- should use [Request Tech Work](https://github.com/hoprnet/hopr-devrel/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/request-for-tech-work.md) template for other work
- issues labelled as `high priority` will be treated as a [file-alarm](./development.md#fire-alarm)
- normal issues will be queued for work in next sprint planning

Once the issue is created, community team must share the github issue in element channel `community` and tag both [representantives](./development.md#representantives).
