# Bounty Processes

The HOPR Association _tech_ members, _community_ members, and [Project Owner](#legend) have agreed on the following bounty processes.

## The bounty

A bounty needs to serve multiple goals.

1. It takes away workload from the _tech_ team as it allows external developers to help improve the HOPR protocol and the various applications/tools we maintain.
2. It gives the _community_ team the opportunity to showcase HOPR's involvement in open source.
3. It allows us to build a relationship between HOPR and the bounty hunter, unlike the usual community outreach, there is no better way to reach the tech community other than giving them bounties.

The primary goal of a bounty creator is to take into account all 3 ascpects, and depending on the bounty, adjust accordingly.
