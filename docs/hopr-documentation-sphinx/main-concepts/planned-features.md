# Planned features

- Security properties:
  - Sender-receiver anonymity
- Scalable anonymity: Senders can choose the degree of anonymity that they want to achieve, especially they'll be able to define:
  - a strategy upon which the intermediate nodes are picked
  - how much cover traffic is sent along the messages
  - how much latency the relay nodes should add
