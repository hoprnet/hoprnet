# Sender-receiver anonymity

The sender is able to communicate with the receiver without knowing which of the nodes in the network belongs to the receiver. More precisely, the success probability that the **sender** of the message is able to detect which node in the network belongs to the receiver is sufficiently low with respect of the number of nodes in the network.

**Remark**: This property allows the sender to prepare a message to the receiver such that the receiver will be able to reply to the sender without knowing which of node in the network belongs to the sender.
