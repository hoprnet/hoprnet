# First Time Users: Start Here

## Welcome!

Welcome to HOPR, a decentralized network which protects both data and metadata privacy. HOPR is still in development, but we'd be delighted for you to test the current build and provide us with feedback.

## Before You Start

To connect to the **HOPR network**, you will need a **HOPR node** and an **app** to communicate with it.

Currently, there are two main ways to build this setup:

- With a [**HOPR Node PC**](https://hoprnet.org/node) or other [**AVADO node**](https://ava.do/) running the HOPR AVADO dApp
- With the HOPR Chat app, which runs on most Windows, MacOS and Linux devices and spins up a HOPR node in the background

If you own a HOPR AVADO hardware node, please head to the [**HOPR AVADO Nodes**](../hopr-avado-node-tutorial/setting-up-your-avado-node.md) section of our documentation, where you can learn more about your hardware node and complete a short tutorial demonstrating the fundamentals of the HOPR network.

To proceed with HOPR Chat on your home device, head [**here**](../hopr-chat-tutorial/quickstart.md).

You can also run HOPR Chat on a virtual private server \(VPS\). Instructions for this will be added soon.

If you run into any difficulties, don't hesitate to contact us on [**Telegram**](https://t.me/hoprnet) or [**Discord**](https://discord.com/invite/dEAWC4G). One of the HOPR Ambassadors will help you.
