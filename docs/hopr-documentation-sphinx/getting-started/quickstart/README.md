# Quickstart

To get started with HOPR, we'll use **HOPR Chat**, a [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop) proof-of-concept command line utility the HOPR team has put together to showcase HOPRâ€™s capabilities as a privacy-preserving communication protocol. **HOPR Chat** allows you to communicate anonymously with other users running **HOPR Chat** on their machines.

To use **HOPR Chat**, your workstation or device running it requires one of the following software:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), a containerisation engine able to virtualise any application.
- [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/), a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.

To learn how to install Docker or Nodejs to test **HOPR Chat** on your operating system, please use the following links:
