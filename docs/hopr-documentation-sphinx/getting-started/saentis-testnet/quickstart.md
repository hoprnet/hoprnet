# First Time Users

{% hint style="danger" %}
HOPR Säntis has ended. Thank you to everyone who participated. We'll be launching a new testnet soon, codenamed Basòdino. Check back soon for more updates.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
If Säntis is your first time using HOPR, you'll need to install a few things first. This guide will walk you through all the steps. If you've already used HOPR before, click [**here**](getting-started.md) for instructions on how to update to the latest version.
{% endhint %}

### Before You Start

To connect to the **HOPR network**, you will need a **HOPR node** and an **app** to communicate with it. This quick-start guide will walk you through installing the **HOPR Chat** app and its dependencies so you can quickly connect to the **HOPR network.** Please follow the step-by-step instructions to ensure everything works.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**HOPR**, **HOPR Chat** and the **HOPR network** are early-stage technologies. The currently available early test versions are meant for the brave explorers who are here to build the future of a more private Web3 together with us. Do not rely on HOPR to protect your privacy or assets just yet!
{% endhint %}

As instructions might vary depending on your operating system \(e.g., Windows, MacOS, Linux\), our instructions will be shown under “Tabs” like the following ones. Please select your operating system before continuing with the guide.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Windows" %}
In some cases, you will need to run commands and instructions as an Administrator. Ensure you have Administrator access and a working Internet connection. Firewall prompts might show up, which only requires you to accept them on request.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="MacOS" %}
For MacOS, we will sometimes give you Keyboard shortcuts to help you navigate the system. We will describe these shortcuts with a combination of keys such as `⌘c` to described the `Command` key followed by the `c` key \(a common shortcut for copying content\). For instance, in this guide we'll make use of the `Spotlight Search`, which you can quickly access by pressing `⌘Space`, which will allow you to quickly look for applications.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Linux" %}
All commands for Linux users will be assumed to be executed in the `Terminal` of your Linux distribution. As access to your `Terminal` can vary depending on your distribution, please make sure you know how to access your `Terminal` before continuing this tutorial.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Step 1 - Install Node.js

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, which powers many modern web applications. Node.js allows users to run web applications with the same technology browsers use to run webpages, but from your local computer. Since **HOPR Chat** runs using JavaScript, we first need to download and install Node.js on your machine.

### Download Node.js

Click the following link to download Node.js version `12.18.2 LTS` in your computer:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Windows" %}
[Click here to download Node.js version 12.18.2 LTS for Windows \(64 bits\)](https://nodejs.org/dist/v12.18.2/node-v12.18.2-x64.msi)
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="MacOS" %}
[Click here to download Node.js version 12.18.2 LTS for macOS](https://nodejs.org/dist/v12.18.2/node-v12.18.2.pkg)
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Linux" %}
For Linux-based operating systems, please go to the official [Downloads](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) page of Node.js or see the instructions for installing Node.js using a [Package Manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/).
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% hint style="info" %}
You can also go to the official Node.js website to [download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) the installer.
{% endhint %}

### Install Node.js

To install Node.js, double-click the file you just downloaded to start the install wizard. The wizard will guide you installing Node.js on your operating system. In most cases, you'll just want to click “Next” for all the options given, similar to the image shown.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/windows_install_nodejs.webp)

### Test Node.js

To check that Node.js was successfully installed, we will run a simple command with Node.js which will output the version number. To do this, we will use your Operating System's `Terminal` to run a command to see the Node.js version.

#### Opening Terminal

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Windows" %}
In Windows, we'll open the `Powershell` application. To do this, you'll need to:

1. Click the `Search Bar` at the bottom of the `Windows Menu`.
2. Type “Powershell” until the app `Windows Powershell` shows up.
3. Press `Enter` or click to open it. A prompt for you to type will show up.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/powershell_open.webp)
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="MacOS" %}
Follow the next instructions to open the `Terminal` application:

1. Press `⌘Space` to open the `Spotlight Search` option.
2. Type “Terminal” until the app `Terminal` shows up.
3. Press `Enter` to open it. A prompt for you to type will show up.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/terminal_open.webp)
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Linux" %}
The `Terminal` application might look different depending on your operating system and/or Linux version. Please Google for the specific instructions according to your distribution.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

#### Running Node Version Command

After your `Terminal` or `Powershell` is open, please type `node -v` in the prompt and press `Enter`. Ensure there's an empty space between the words `node` and `-v`

![Type “node -v” to find your node version. It should show v12.18.2](../../.gitbook/assets/node-version.gif)

If your screen shows `v12.18.2` you are ready to go!

## Step 2 - Get HOPR Chat

With Node.js successfully installed on your system, you're ready to download **HOPR Chat,** which is distributed as a zip file. **HOPR Chat** will automatically spin up a **HOPR node** and will allow you to control that node and send data to other **HOPR users** and the various **HOPR bots**.

### Download HOPR Chat

Download the latest version of **HOPR Chat** by clicking in the following link.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Windows" %}
[Download the latest Windows release.](https://github.com/hoprnet/hopr-chat/releases/download/v1.13.0-saentis.testnet/hopr-chat-nodebin-windows.zip)
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="MacOS" %}
[Download the latest macOS release.](https://github.com/hoprnet/hopr-chat/releases/download/v1.13.0-saentis.testnet/hopr-chat-nodebin-macos.zip)
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Linux" %}
[Download the latest Linux release.](https://github.com/hoprnet/hopr-chat/releases/download/v1.13.0-saentis.testnet/hopr-chat-nodebin-linux.zip)
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% hint style="info" %}
You can see all our releases in our GitHub [releases](https://github.com/hoprnet/hopr-core/releases) page.
{% endhint %}

### Extracting HOPR Chat

Right now, **HOPR Chat** is distributed as a .zip file, so you will need to “unzip” its contents first.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Windows" %}
For Windows, select the option “Extract All” in the File Explorer to extract **HOPR Chat** files.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/downloading_hopr_bin.webp)
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="MacOS" %}
For MacOS, just double click on the `.zip` file you downloaded to see the contents of the **HOPR Chat** application.

![HOPR Chat contents of the extracted content should look as follows.](../../.gitbook/assets/hopr-macos-contents.webp)

You can also do this from your Browser by just clicking the tab that shows up the downloaded folder.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Linux" %}
In Linux, you need to use `unzip` or similar utility to extract the contents to run **HOPR Chat.** Use your Linux distribution package manager to install and afterwards run in your `Terminal` application the following command in the directory you downloaded **HOPR Chat.**

```bash
$ unzip hopr-chat-nodebin-linux.zip
```

The contents fo the extracted folder should look as follows:

![HOPR Chat contents extracted as seen in a Linux terminal using the ls command](../../.gitbook/assets/hopr-linux-contents.webp)
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Step 3 - Run HOPR Chat

**HOPR Chat** is an interactive chat application. To run, you need to click on the executable you previously extracted in the last step.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Windows" %}
For Windows, double-click the file named `start-hopr-chat` with `.bat` extension and described as `Windows Batch File` in its Type attribute.

![HOPR Chat executable file for Windows.](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2814%29.png)
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="MacOS" %}
For macOS, double-click on the file named `start-hopr-chat.command` with `.command` extension and described as `Terminal shell script` in its Kind attribute.

![HOPR Chat executable as seen in MacOS](../../.gitbook/assets/hopr-macos-contents.webp)

When opening the `start-hopr-chat.command` file, you will be prompted by `Gatekeeper`, the security mechanism from macOS, that the application has been downloaded by a non-recognised URL. This is a security mechanism activated by default in macOS.

To go ahead, you will need to tell `Gatekeeper` that the application is to be trusted. To do so, open `Security & Privacy` in your `System Preferences` and click `Open Anyway`under the `General` tab. This will prompt `Gatekeeper` to ask you again to open **HOPR Chat** with an option to actually run it. Select `Open` and you will see **HOPR Chat** in your screen.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/hopr_macos_gatekeeper.webp)
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Linux" %}
For Linux-based systems, execute the file named `start-hopr-chat.sh` with `.sh` extension and provided with executable permissions on your directory.

![HOPR Chat executable as seen in a Linux terminal](../../.gitbook/assets/hopr-linux-contents.webp)
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

Running these commands will bring up a screen similar the one shown below. Congratulations! You are now running **HOPR Chat**.
