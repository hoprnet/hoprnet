# xHOPR Tokens

The HOPR mainnet will run on the Ethereum chain, and HOPR will be an ERC-20 compatible token.

The S채ntis testnet runs on xDAI Chain, a sidechain of Ethereum, so requires an xDAI-compatible token. That's why the testnet will use xHOPR.

Just like in the HOPR mainnet, you'll receive xHOPR when you relay data to other users in the network. At the moment these xHOPR are distributed by our bot, but soon we'll be turning on the probabilistic micropayment and ticketing system. This page will be updated when that happens.

xHOPR works like the HOPR token will: you receive it for relaying and mixing data in the HOPR mixnet, and you spend it to send data.

You can check your xHOPR balance at any time by typing `balance` in HOPR Chat or in your HOPR PC Node. This will also show you your xDAI balance.

**IMPORTANT:** The xHOPR token will only work on S채ntis testnet. It is not the final HOPR token that will run on mainnet and for legal reasons xHOPR tokens cannot be transferred to HOPR tokens. Prizes for the S채ntis testnet will be solely determined by your final score on the leaderboard, not the number of xHOPR tokens you control.
