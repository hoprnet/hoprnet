description: An introduction to bootstrap nodes inside HOPR Chat

# Bootstrap Nodes

**HOPR Chat** currently relies on **bootstrap nodes** to work. These are nodes created with the `bootstrap` setting enabled, functioning solely as relayers for other nodes in the network.

**Bootstrap nodes** are only meant to serve as an initial relayer between nodes. Once communication has been established between two or more **HOPR Chat** nodes, it is no longer necessary to communicate with a **bootstrap node**.

As an analogy, think of **bootstrap nodes** as the hosts at a party. They introduce guests to each other, and those guests can then talk directly.

To run **HOPR Chat** as a bootstrap node, pass a `-b` flag to the run command.

## Available Bootstrap Nodes

Feel free to use any \(or all\) of the following URLs as your `BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS` parameter in your **HOPR Chat** Docker image. Each of our **Bootstrap Nodes** are located in different countries and serve a specific environment.

**Status**: ‚úÖ Beta

Our **Testnet Bootstrap Nodes** are fixed and deployed via our [GitHub DevOps repository](https://github.com/hoprnet/hopr-devops). These are currently being considered _beta_ technology and might be replaced at different times. However, we will notify our users when doing so via our [Telegram Channel](http://t.me/hoprnet).

These nodes are behind HOPR Services AG DNS registry. In case you want to directly access them without the DNS request, you can simply pass these directly.

#### Develop Bootstrap Nodes

[![Terraform](https://github.com/hoprnet/hopr-devops/workflows/Terraform/badge.svg)](https://github.com/hoprnet/hopr-devops/workflows/Terraform/badge.svg)

**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Alpha

Our **Develop Bootstrap Nodes** are constantly changing and deployed via our [GitHub DevOps repository](https://github.com/hoprnet/hopr-devops). These are currently being considered _alpha_ technology and are replaced multiple times over the week. To use or test them, please check our [Builds Page](https://github.com/hoprnet/hopr-devops/actions?query=workflow%3ATerraform).
