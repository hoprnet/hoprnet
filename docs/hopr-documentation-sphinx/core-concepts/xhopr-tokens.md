# HOPR Tokens

The HOPR mainnet will run on the Ethereum chain, and HOPR will be an ERC-20 compatible token.

The SÃ¤ntis testnet runs on xDAI Chain, a sidechain of Ethereum, so requires an xDAI-compatible token. That's why the testnet will use HOPR.

Just like in the HOPR mainnet, you'll receive HOPR when you relay data to other users in the network. At the moment these HOPR are distributed by our bot, but soon we'll be turning on the probabilistic micropayment and ticketing system. This page will be updated when that happens.

HOPR works like the HOPR token will: you receive it for relaying and mixing data in the HOPR mixnet, and you spend it to send data.

You can check your HOPR balance at any time by typing `balance` in HOPR Chat or in your HOPR PC Node. This will also show you your xDAI balance.

**IMPORTANT:** The HOPR token will only work on our HOPR testnets. It is not the final HOPR token that will run on mainnet and for legal reasons HOPR tokens cannot be transferred to HOPR tokens. Prizes for our testnets will be solely determined by your final score on the testnet leaderboard, not the number of HOPR tokens you control.
