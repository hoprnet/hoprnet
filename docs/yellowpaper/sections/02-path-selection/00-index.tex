\section{Path Selection}
\label{sec:path-selection}
HOPR currently utilizes free-route sender-selected paths which are known to provide better privacy than other topologies, as well as better packet delivery in the event of partial network failure \cite{Dingledine2004SynchronousBF}. HOPR makes it easy to customize various different routing strategies. In this section, we present the free-routing strategy that HOPR nodes are currently following. Another strategy is later introduced in the \lcnameref{sec:CT} section.
