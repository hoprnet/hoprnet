\section{Key Derivation}
\label{appendix:keyderivation}

During a protocol execution, a node derives a master secret from the SPHINX header that then used to derive multiple sub-secrets for several purposes by using BLAKE2s within HKDF. HKDF is given by two algorithms: $\mathsf{extract}$ and $\mathsf{expand}$ where $\mathsf{extract}$ is used to extract the entropy from a given secret $s$, such as an elliptic-curve point, and produces the intermediate keying material (IKM). The IKM then serves as a master secret to feed $\mathsf{expand}$ in order to derive pseudorandom subkeys in the desired length.

\subsection{Extraction}

As a result of the packet creation and its transformation, the sender is able to derive a shared secret $s_i$ given as a compressed elliptic-curve point (33 bytes) with each of the nodes along the path.

$$s_i^{master} \longleftarrow \mathsf{extract}(s_i, 33, pubKey)$$

By adding their own public key $pubKey$ as a salt, each node derives a unique $s_i^{master}$ for each $s_i$.

\subsection{Expansion}

Each subkey $s_i^{sub}$ is used for one purpose, such as keying the \textit{pseudorandomness generator} (PRG).

$$s_i^{sub} \longleftarrow \mathsf{expand}(s_i^{master}, length(purpose), hashKey(purpose))$$

Since the values for PoR are used as field elements on the curve, there exists a non-zero probability that the application of $\mathsf{expand}$ leads to a value outside of the field. In this case, the hash key is padded by ``\_'' until it leads to a field element.
