\section{Path Selection}
\label{sec:pathselection}

To send packets through the HOPR network, each node must
decide which path a packet is sent via. This decision, called
\textbf{path selection}, must be performed for every packet. HOPR uses a
random selection algorithm to determine the identities of nodes participating in
the network relaying service, both generally and for each particular packet.
\\~\\The selection process is divided into two steps:

\begin{enumerate}

    \item \textbf{Pre-Selection:}
          Initially, a subset $m<<n$ nodes will be selected based on the following factors:
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Node availability
              \item Payment channel graph
              \item Payment channel stake
          \end{itemize}
          Each node receives a weight that is proportional to these factors.

    \item \textbf{Random Selection:} Each edge (from node $A$ to $B$) within the subset
      $m$ is assigned a random number $r_i$. Edges are then sorted by
      $$r_i*weight(edge_i).$$ The path with the largest weight is extended next,
      using a priority queue mechanism.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Node Availability}
\label{sec:nodeavailability}

Node availability is estimated using a heartbeat protocol. Each node maintains a
list of its neighbouring nodes within the network. A node will \textit{ping} neighbours and
respond to \textit{pings} from other nodes to determine whether they are online or offline.
A node is considered online if the ping response (``pong‚Äù) returns within a
certain timeframe. Otherwise, the node is considered offline and the waiting
time before the next ping attempt to that node is doubled. Newly working pings will gladually improve a
neighbour's availability score.

\subsection{Payment channel graph}

Every node that intends to send messages needs to have a basic understanding
about the topology of the network, meanings whether a payment channel to the node is open and
funded with sufficient HOPR tokens for the relaying service. If no such
payment channel exists, the sender creates a new channel and funds it with
sufficient HOPR tokens.

\subsection{Payment channel stake}

As payment channels are opened with other nodes, HOPR tokes are staked in those channels and therefore the network as a whole. Nodes use these HOPR
tokens to cover transaction costs when interacting with the blockchain. The higher
the stake a node has locked, the higher probability that it will be chosen as a relayer.
