\subsection{Cover traffic nodes}
\label{sec:ct:nodes}

Cover traffic nodes (CT nodes) are HOPR nodes with a cover traffic service enabled, initially run by the HOPR Association (or third parties sponsored by the HOPR Association) for the purpose of generating cover traffic. In the future, anyone who fulfils the requirements for running a CT node in the HOPR network will be able to start one.
