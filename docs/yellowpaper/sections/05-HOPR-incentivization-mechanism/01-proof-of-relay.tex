\subsection{Proof of Relay}
\label{sec:proofofrelay}

HOPR incentivizes packet transformation and delivery using a mechanism called \textbf{proof of relay}. This mechanism guarantees that a node's relay services are verifiable.

\paragraph{Construction}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Every packet is sent together with a ticket.
    \item Each ticket contains a challenge.
    \item The validity of a ticket can only be checked on reception of the packet but the on-chain logic enforces a solution to the challenge stated in the ticket.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Challenge and Hint}
\label{sec:PoR:Challenge}

$A$ creates a shared group element $\alpha_i$ with all the relay nodes in the channel (B-C-D-Z) by using an offline version of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange as introduced in section \nameref{sec:sphinx:keyderivation}. This shared key is a session key generated from the master DH Sphinx key and will be used to derive new keys $s_i^{(0)}$ and $s_{i}^{(1)}$.  The first key, $s_i^{(0)}$, will be used as the node's \textit{own key share} and the second key, $s_i^{(1)}$, will be used as the \textit{acknowledgement key}. The acknowledgement key will be embedded in the acknowledgement for a packet and thereby unlocks the reward for the previous relayer, earned for transforming and delivering the packet.

\paragraph{Key derivation}


If the result of HKDF does not lead to a field element, $hashKey$ is padded until it does.

$A$ provides a hint to the expected value $s_{i+1}^{(1)}$ that a node $n_i$ is expected to get from the next downstream node.
The hint value, $H$, is computed as
\begin{align}
    H_i & =s_{i+1}^{(1)}*G,
\end{align}
where $*$ is the curve multiplication operation and $G$ is a generator of the curve (the same used in the \nameref{sec:sphinx} section).

The hint for party $n_i$ is used to check whether the returned value $s_{i+1}'^{(1)}$ matches the promised value $s_{i+1}^{(1)}$ by checking whether $H_i$ equals $s_{i+1}'^{(1)}*G$.

The sender $A$ also creates a challenge $T_{c_i}$, such that
\begin{align}
    T_{c_i} & =(s_i^{(0)}+s_{i+1}^{(1)})*G
\end{align}
Since proof of relay is used to ensure the relay services of nodes are verifiable, it is the duty of each node to check that given challenges are derivable from the given and expected information. Packets with inappropriate challenges should be dropped, as they might not result in winning tickets with the expected probability (see Section \ref{sec:tickets}).

The values $H_i$ and $T_{c_i}$ are sent with the routing information $\beta_i$ as follows:
$$\beta_i=y_{i+1}\|H_i\|T_{c_i}\|\gamma_{i+1}\|\beta_{{i+1}_{[ \,0....(2r-1)\kappa-1\,] }}\oplus \rho(h_{\rho}(s_{i}))_{[ \,0....(2r+1)\kappa-1\,]}$$
By decrypting $\beta_i$, each mix node $n_i$ will retrieve the public key of the next downstream node and both the hint and challenge required by proof of relay to ensure relay services are verifiable.
