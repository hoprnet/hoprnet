\section{Incentivization Mechanism}
\label{sec:incentiviationmechanism}

The HOPR protocol provides incentives to nodes in the network to achieve correct
transformation and delivery of mixnet packets. This is accomplished through a
combination of \textbf{proof of relay}, a novel mechanism which is
cost effective and privacy preserving, and \textbf{probabilisitic payments}.
The high-level overview of the motivation behind this incentive scheme was covered in the
\nameref{sec:introduction}. This section focuses on the technical details used to implement the mechanism.
