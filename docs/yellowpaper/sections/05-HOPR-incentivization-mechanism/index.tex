\section{Incentivization Mechanism}
\label{sec:incentiviationmechanism}

The HOPR protocol provides incentives to nodes in the network to achieve correct transformation and delivery of mixnet packets. This is accomplished through a combination of \href{sec:proofofrelay}{\textbf{proof of relay}}, a novel mechanism which is cost effective and privacy preserving, and \href{sec:probabilisticpayments}{\textbf{probabilisitic payments}}, together with an on-chain \href{sec:onchaincommitment}{\textbf{commitment scheme}}. The high-level overview of the motivation behind this incentive scheme was covered in the \href{sec:introduction}{introduction}. This section focuses on the technical details used to implement the mechanism.

\paragraph{Construction}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Every packet is sent together with a ticket.
    \item Each ticket contains a challenge.
    \item The validity of a ticket can be checked on reception of the packet but the on-chain logic enforces a solution to the challenge stated in the ticket.
    \item The challenge can be solved \textit{after} the packet has been forwarded.
\end{itemize}
