\section{Incentivization Mechanism}

The HOPR protocol provides incentives to nodes in the network to achieve correct
transformation and delivery of mixnet packets. This is accomplished using
\textbf{Proof-of-Relay}, a novel mechanism which is both cost-effective and
privacy-preserving. While the high-level overview of the incentives has been
covered in the \nameref{sec:introduction}, this section focuses on the
technical details which are used to realize the mechanism.
