\section{Incentivization Mechanism}
\label{sec:incentives}

The HOPR protocol provides incentives to nodes in the network to achieve correct transformation and delivery of mixnet packets. This is accomplished through a combination of \lcnameref{sec:incentives:proofofrelay}, a novel mechanism which is cost effective and privacy preserving, and \lcnameref{sec:incentives:probabilistic}. The high-level overview of the motivation behind this incentive scheme was covered in the \lcnameref{sec:intro}. This section focuses on the technical details used to implement the mechanism.

\paragraph{Construction}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Every packet is sent together with a ticket.
    \item Each ticket contains a challenge.
    \item The validity of a ticket can be checked on receipt of the packet, but the on-chain logic enforces a solution to the challenge stated in the ticket.
    \item The challenge can be solved after the packet has been forwarded.
\end{itemize}
