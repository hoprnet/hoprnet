\subsection{Incentivized Behavior}
\label{sec:incentives:behavior}

Relaying a mixnet packet requires computation to transform it such that it can either get sent to the next downstream node $n_{i+1}$ or forwarded to the user. In case the packet is relayed, the relayer needs to establish a connection to node $n_{i+1}$ and cache the transformed mixnet packet for a short period of time until it is able to deliver it - or drop the transformed packet because node $n_{i+1}$ appeared to be unreachable.

Transforming and delivering packets are those mechanisms that are most crucial to keep the HOPR network running, therefore they are incentivized by the protocol. On the other hand, receiving a packet is not incentivized.
