## Summary

This release concludes the migration of `hoprd` from being a NodeJS-based
application to a native application written in Rust. All run targets are now
native binaries. The release features improved resource consumption and better
configurability.

We recommend users upgrade their `2.0.x` nodes to benefit from these changes.
For up-to-date information on how to run the most recent version of `hoprd`
refer to the user documentation at https://docs.hoprnet.org/node/start-here

## Important: Breaking Changes

While this release is backwards-compatible with `2.0.x` on the
p2p and on-chain layers, it includes some changes in the HTTP API, CLI and
configuration file which require manual intervention to ensure a node keeps working
after upgrading to `2.1.0`.

### CLI

The available CLI arguments were cleaned up and reduced to the minimum arguments
while most of the `hoprd` functionality can now be configured through a separate
configuration file set through `--configurationFilePath`.

Important changes:

Deprecation of `--healthCheck`, `--healthCheckHost` and `--healthCheckPort`
because the underlying functionality has been removed.
Deprecation of `--dryRun`
because the underlying functionality has been removed.

For reference check the output of `--help`, see https://hoprnet.github.io/hoprnet/#usage

### Configuration

All of `hoprd` configuration can be done through a single YAML configuration
file. The file can be provided at startup through the CLI argument
`--configurationFilePath`.

A reference configuration file showing the full structure can be seen here:

https://github.com/hoprnet/hoprnet/blob/v2.1.0/hoprd/hoprd/example_cfg.yaml

Some configuration values can be overloaded through their respective CLI
arguments, and further through their respective environment variables.

The configuration file itself can be partial, missing values will be merged with
the internal default configuration.

### HTTP API

The swagger schema for the v3 API has become stricter in terms of input/output
value definitions. This may break clients which were using values outside the supported ranges, requiring clients to be made compatible with the changed
schema.

All supported clients (JS, Python) were fixed and support the HTTP API v3 in
`2.1.0`.

The schema differences can be inspected here:
