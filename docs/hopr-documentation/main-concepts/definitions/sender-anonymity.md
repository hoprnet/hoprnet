# Sender anonymity

Neither the receiver nor a potential adversary who is able to observe the communication in the network is unable to determine which of the nodes has sent the message. More precisely, the success probability that the adversary determines the sender of the message is sufficiently low with respect to number of nodes in the network.

**Remark**: The sender can specify its identity inside the payload to link his identity to the message, but he does not need to.
