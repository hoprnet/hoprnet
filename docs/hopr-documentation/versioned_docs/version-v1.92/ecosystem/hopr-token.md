title: HOPR Token
---

It all starts with the `HOPR` token.

The HOPR token has three main uses:

1. Users can pay with HOPR tokens to send data through the HOPR network privately and securely.
2. Node runners can stake HOPR tokens in their nodes to be rewarded for relaying data. Node runners receive fees in HOPR for the data they help to relay, including a large number of tokens distributed in the form of cover traffic.
3. Users can stake their HOPR tokens, allowing them to earn more HOPR tokens.
4. Finally, the HOPR token gives users voting power in the HOPR Association DAO.

You can buy HOPR tokens using this [guide](https://docs.hoprnet.org/staking/how-to-get-hopr).
