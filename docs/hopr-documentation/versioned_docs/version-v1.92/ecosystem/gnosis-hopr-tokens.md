title: Gnosis HOPR tokens

One key feature of the HOPR protocol is the ability to work with various EVM compatible blockchains.
When HOPR token was launched, it was first deployed in the Ethereum blockchain.
As the gas prices of the ethereum blockchain increased, the HOPR team looked for other, cheaper alternatives to use.

Currently, our latest public release uses the Gnosis Chain, this means that you need to have Gnosis' HOPR tokens.

There is `xHOPR` token which is a token that is created through the bridge, and the `wxHOPR` which wraps `xHOPR` so it's usable in HOPRd. You can find how to convert `HOPR` <-> `xHOPR` <-> `wxHOPR` and vice-versa in this [guide](https://docs.hoprnet.org/staking/convert-hopr).
