title: Smart Contract Overview
---

**HoprChannels** is the main smart contract of HOPR protocol. It manages the payment channel between HOPR nodes and the announcement of public nodes.

### Lifecycle of payment channel

A payment channel runs throug multiple states during its lifecycle, as shown in the figure below.

1. Initially, each payment channel is **Closed**.
2. Node can lock some assets to payment channels, which leads to the status of **Wait for commitement**.
3. When the destination channel sets a commitment, the payment channel is considered as **Open**. If the counterparty has already set commitment, then funding immediately changes the state to **Open**.
4. When closing a payment channel, the payment channel first goes into **Pending to close**. Channels need to wait for a timeout for nodes to redeem tickets and thus retrieve the assets. In rare cases it can happen that the counterparty does not submit an on-chain commit after a node intends to open a payment channel. Under this circumstance, the channel can be turned immediately into **Pending to close**.
5. Once the timeout is done, any of the involving nodes can finalize the closure and turn the payment channel state into **Closed**.
