# Using NPM

The NPM setup allows you to install and run **HOPRd** as a Node.js application, ensuring your experience is a close as to the developerâ€™s have when developing **HOPRd** and the **HOPR Core** protocol. Node.js might require further software installation, but is able to be run in less hardware demanding machines, while taking considerable less space in comparison to Docker \(i.e. 50mb\).

## Installing NPM

In order to get NPM on your machine, you will need to install Node.js, our recommended way of doing this is to install [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) / [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows), a Node.js version manager. This ensures we can install and uninstall as many versions of Node.js as needed. Furthermore, it will help you installing any additional requirements \(if any\) for running Node.js.

Please bear in mind you might need to restart your terminal after running these commands.

## Installing Node.js

After you have downloaded and setup nvm in your machine \(run `nvm ls` to ensure everything is in place\), now you need to install a specific version of Node.js before running **HOPRd**.

At the time of writing, **HOPRd** runs on Node.js `v16`. Specifically, **HOPRd** has been developed and tested in `v16`, so in case you run on any issues with **HOPRd,** try switch to `v16` to see if those issues disappear.

To install Node.js with nvm, run the following

```bash
$ nvm install 16
$ nvm use 16
```

If everything was done properly, you can run `node --version` to see your current `node` version, alongside running basic commands as shown when running simply `node` in your terminal.

:::info INFO
MacOS M1 users will need to follow an extra set of instructions from [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#macos-troubleshooting) to allow them to use Node.js 16.

## Installing HOPRd using NPM

```bash
$ mkdir athens
$ cd athens
$ npm install @hoprnet/hoprd@1.86.20
```

## Running HOPRd

### run hoprd

Before starting a HOPR node, please create your own **Secret Token**. Replace "**<YOUR_SECRET_TOKEN\>**" with your own Secret Token and only then paste the command.

```bash
DEBUG="hopr*" npx hoprd --init --admin --identity ./hoprd-id-athens --data ./hoprd-db-athens --password='open-sesame-iTwnsPNg0hpagP+o6T0KOwiH9RQ0' --rest --restHost "0.0.0.0" --restPort 3001 --apiToken='<YOUR_SECRET_TOKEN>'
```

:::danger Important

Create your own password and replace it with **<YOUR_SECRET_TOKEN\>** (don't use "<\>").

Password should contain:

- at least 8 symbols
- a lowercase letter
- uppercase letter
- a number
- a special symbol

This ensures the node cannot be accessed by a malicious user residing in the same network.

The installation process has been finished! Now you can proceed to [Guide using a hoprd node](guide-using-a-hoprd-node).
