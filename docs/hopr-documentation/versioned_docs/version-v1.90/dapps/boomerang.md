(**1**) Enter a message into the "Send a message" field.

(**2**) Click the button labelled "Send message to node".

(**3**) You should see the message you entered appear below the button. It has been mixed through multiple nodes to arrive privately back to you.

This is one of the best dApps to start with when learning to build on the HOPR network. View our step-by-step tutorial here.
