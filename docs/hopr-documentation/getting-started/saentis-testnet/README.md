# Säntis Testnet

{% hint style="danger" %}
HOPR Säntis has ended. Thank you to everyone who participated. We'll be launching a new testnet soon, codenamed Basòdino. Check back soon for more updates.
{% endhint %}

Säntis is an incentivized HOPR testnet which will run on [xDAI Chain](https://www.xdaichain.com/) for three weeks, and provides community members with their first chance to earn HOPR tokens.

Connect a node to Säntis to help us test the network, find bugs, and learn how HOPR works. You'll also earn points which can win you a share of 100,000 HOPR tokens when mainnet launches later in the year.

Säntis will run from 5pm CEST on Wednesday 16th September 2020 until 5pm CEST on Tuesday 6th October 2020.

If this is your first time using HOPR, please see our [**setup guide**](quickstart.md) for first-time users.

If you already have HOPR Chat installed or a HOPR PC Node, head to [https://saentis.hoprnet.org](https://saentis.hoprnet.org) to get started, or click [**here**](getting-started.md) for more instructions.

If you're having difficulty, check out the [**Troubleshooting**](troubleshooting.md) page or talk to us on our \***\*[**Discord channel\*\*](https://discord.gg/wUSYqpD).
