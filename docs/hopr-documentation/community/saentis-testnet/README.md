Säntis was an incentivized HOPR testnet which ran on [xDAI Chain](https://www.xdaichain.com/) from 5pm CEST on Wednesday 16th September 2020 until 5pm CEST on Tuesday 6th October 2020. You can find a list of winners [here](https://medium.com/hoprnet/oh-my-hopness-100-000-more-hopr-tokens-for-s%C3%A4ntis-63ef8efa6c68).

Like all of our builds, Säntis was named after a mountain in HOPR's home country of Switzerland. On a clear day, you can see six different countries from the summit!
