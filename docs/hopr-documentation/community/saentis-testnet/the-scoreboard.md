# Scoreboard and Prizes

{% hint style="danger" %}
HOPR Säntis has ended. Thank you to everyone who participated. We'll be launching a new testnet soon, codenamed Basòdino. Check back soon for more updates.
{% endhint %}

The scoreboard shows the nodes which have earned the most points completing tasks in the testnet. You can check the scoreboard at any time by visiting [https://saentis.hoprnet.org](https://saentis.hoprnet.org)

You'll receive 100 points the first time you register your node with CoverBot. Every time CoverBot selects your node to relay data, it will send you **1** [**HOPR token**](../../core-concepts/HOPR-tokens.md) and award you a further 10 points. More ways to earn points will be revealed as Säntis progresses, so keep checking back here for more information.

At the end of the testnet, the top 20 scoring testnet participants will be eligible to receive a share of the 100,000 HOPR prize fund. These prizes will be paid out in HOPR tokens once mainnet launches.

| 11-20 | 1,000             |

There will also be 10 random prizes or 1,000 HOPR awarded to participants who did not score in the top 20.

Säntis will integrate with the next season of HOPR Games, which will launch very soon. Follow our Telegram, Twitter and Discord for more information about ways to earn more points and xDAI. There may even be opportunities to expand the prize fund and prize distribution!
