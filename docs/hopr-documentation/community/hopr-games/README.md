# HOPR Games

To showcase the usage of the HOPR Protocol, we've created the **HOPR Games**, a series of games or other activities which work via the HOPR Protocol.

## Goals

The HOPR Games should help grow / develop HOPR as a project. It should teach our members about our product, as well as data privacy. HOPR Games is devised with these goals at heart:

* **Teach \(α\)**. We have to educate people about HOPR. We must also discover what problems there are with our protocol.
* **Media outreach \(β\).** We have to grow our reach via social media platforms. We should distribute HOPR to multiple outlets for more exposure.
* **Recruit members \(γ\).** We should attract users — from traders & developers to the just curious. We'll create a broad ecosystem where people should be able to rally to our goals.
* **Improve the project \(δ\).** We have to improve the protocol & its use cases. Our users will help us discover features which solve problems for all users.
* **Test protocol \(ε\).** We should push the limits of our protocol outside of our shared idea of what it does. To make sure HOPR will survive this load, we should stress it at every step.
