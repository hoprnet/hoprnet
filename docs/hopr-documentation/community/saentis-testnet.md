Säntis was an incentivized HOPR testnet which ran on [xDAI Chain](https://www.xdaichain.com/) from 5pm CEST on Wednesday 16th September 2020 until 5pm CEST on Tuesday 6th October 2020.

Like all of our builds, Säntis was named after a mountain in HOPR's home country of Switzerland. On a clear day, you can see six different countries from the summit!
