# Daily Task Day 8

My first is in MATIC but not in xDAI

My second’s in PRIVACY, but isn’t in SPY

My third’s found within the mysterious SPHINX

My fourth is a letter not found [**at**](../hopr-games/) [**these**](../hopr-games/#goals) [**links**](../hopr-games/#extra-daily-task-clue).

My fifth and my sixth are both in METADATA

My whole is how HOPR makes life online safer.

Once you have the password, send it to `16Uiu2HAkvc8JAxoKb1BzZo7SYMt8iMQi8FrPCEZLDHRm13mu8JEn`
