# Exploring The Network

Now that your AVADO node is up and running, it's time to explore the network.

Type `crawl` and you will see a message detailing how many other nodes are visible to your node.

{% hint style="info" %}
If your node has just started, it may not have built a full picture of how many nodes are available to communicate with. If the number of peers seems low, try crawling again to find more.
{% endhint %}

Next, type `listConnectedPeers` to see the addresses of the other nodes which are currently online and visible to your node.

{% hint style="info" %}
The list of connected peers will sometimes show fewer nodes than the number returned by `crawl.` This is because nodes which go offline are not immediately removed from your node's list of possible connections.
{% endhint %}

Addresses are shown in their shortened form, showing only the last five characters. Click on any shortened address to expand it to show the entire address string.

## Finding Your Own Address

To find your own address, type `myAddress`. Once again, you'll need to click the short-form address to expand it. The `myAddress` command will also show the wallet address you used to fund your account.

Now that we've scoped out the network, it's time to start sending some messages. The next section will explain how.
