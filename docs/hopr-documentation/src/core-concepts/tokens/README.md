# Tokens

To use HOPR, you'll need two types of token:

- a HOPR token
- the native token of the blockchain the HOPR token is linked to

The HOPR testnet is currently running on Ropsten Chain, a testnet for Ethereum, so the native token is ETH. The HOPR token for the testnet is HOPR.

After mainnet launch, the native token will be ETH and the HOPR token will simply be HOPR. However, for our various testnets HOPR will be running on a variety of different chains.
