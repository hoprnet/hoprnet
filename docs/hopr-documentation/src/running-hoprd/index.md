description: The tokens used on the HOPR network

# Start Here

These instructions assume you have installed HOPRd on your machine and you are able to access http://localhost:3000/.

To use HOPR, you'll need two types of funds:

- the native token of the blockchain the HOPR token is linked to (for example: ETH)
- HOPR token

The HOPR testnet is currently running on Goerli Chain, a testnet for Ethereum, so the native token is ETH.
In this testnet, we have deployed the HOPR Token in [this address](https://goerli.etherscan.io/token/0x566a5c774bb8ABE1A88B4f187e24d4cD55C207A5).

<!-- After mainnet launch, the native token will be ETH and the HOPR token will simply be HOPR. However, for our various testnets HOPR will be running on a variety of different chains. -->
