description: The tokens used on the HOPR network

# Start Here

These instructions assume you have installed HOPRd on your machine and you are able to access [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).

To use HOPR, you'll need two types of funds:

- the native token of the blockchain the HOPR token is linked to (for example: ETH)
- HOPR token

The HOPR network is currently running on xDAI, a [side-chain](https://www.xdaichain.com/) of Ethereum, which means the native token is *xDAI*.
On xDAI, the HOPR Token, called *xHOPR*, is deployed in [this address](https://blockscout.com/poa/xdai/address/0x12481c3Ed97b32D94E71C2039DBC44432ADD39a0/transactions).

<!-- After mainnet launch, the native token will be gETH and the HOPR token will simply be HOPR. However, for our various testnets HOPR will be running on a variety of different chains. -->
