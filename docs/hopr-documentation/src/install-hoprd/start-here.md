To use HOPR, you will need a HOPR node. There are several ways to run a HOPR node: you can use your own device, install one on a virtual private server (VPS) or use a dedicated hardware device such as the AVADO HOPR Node PC.

Regardless of which way you install your HOPR node, you will access it and interact with it through your browser. By default, these instructions assume you'll be visiting http://localhost:3000/
