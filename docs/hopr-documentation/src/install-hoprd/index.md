   The HOPR client software is still under development. Please do *not* add funds to the node that you cannot lose.

To use the HOPR network, you will need a HOPR node. There are several ways to run a HOPR node: you can use your own device, install one on a virtual private server (VPS) or use a dedicated hardware device such as the AVADO HOPR Node PC.

Regardless of which way you install your HOPR node, you will access it and interact with it through your browser.
