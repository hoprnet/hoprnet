## What is the Network Registry?

The Network Registry is a list of nodes allowed to interact with others on the network. This is a utility used by HOPR to scale and test the network at a controlled pace.

This restriction on the access guarded by the "Network Registry" is only enabled in the staging or production environment by default. If you run a cluster of HOPR nodes locally in the anvil network, the "Network Registry" is not enabled.

## Monte Rosa Release

The Network Registry is being used for the Monte Rosa release, so please make sure you are eligible and have been registered before trying to use this environment. To add your node to the registry, you must first register your interest to participate in the release.

By completing the form, you will be supplying your associated staking address, which will be the primary indicator of your eligibility to be added to the registry.

### Eligibility

From the list of interested participants, an ordered waitlist will be generated. Your staking address determines this, it will be given a score based on NFT holdings from previous testnets/staking seasons and HOPR tokens currently staked.

Users from the waitlist will be added to the registry in blocks of 20. Most of these 20 will be the highest-ranking unregistered participants on the waitlist. But one of every 20 will be given randomly to people further down the list (so you always have a chance of being added even if you don't have the highest rank).

You can view the current waitlist and the registered participants here.

### Joining the Registry

If chosen to join the registry, you will be sent an NFT to your provided staking address. From here, you should install your node and get its peerID.

Once you have both the NFT in your staking account and your peerID, you can visit our registration site and enter both details. These are checked automatically, and if you are indeed eligible, your NFT will be staked, your node will be funded with both mHOPR and xDAI, and your details will be added to the Network Registry smart contract.

You can then proceed to (or continue) our tutorial and begin using the hopr-admin!
