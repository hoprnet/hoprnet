title: HOPR Apps - Hello world
---

The following is a 5-minute guide to help you get familiar with the HOPR protocol and start developing apps on top of the
HOPR network by learning how to send and read messages between two nodes.

## Requirements

### 1. Previous guides

Before getting started, we suggest you get familiar with the following concepts:

- ["HOPR Cluster Development Setup"](/developers/starting-local-cluster)
- ["Interacting with a HOPR node"](/developers/connecting-node)

### 2. HOPR Cluster & exported variables

Make sure you have a HOPR cluster[^1] available for you to connect. Also, make sure to have the equivalent of at least `2`
node endpoints (both HTTP and WS). Here are the default values for each of these endpoints.

    <h3>apiToken</h3>

    </pre>
    <h3>HOPR_NODE_1_HTTP_URL</h3>
    <pre>
    http://127.0.0.1:13301
    </pre>
    <h3>HOPR_NODE_1_WS_URL</h3>
    <pre>
    http://127.0.0.1:19501
    </pre>
    <h3>HOPR_NODE_2_HTTP_URL</h3>

We'll assume your HOPR nodes were run using the instructions from ["HOPR Cluster Development Setup"](/developers/starting-local-cluster). If you are looking to
interact with your node via a terminal, we suggest you copy/paste the following commands every time you open a new
terminal.

## Connect to your nodes

### 1. Connect to the WebSocket server of `node 2`

Using `websocat` or any other WebSocket client, connect to `node 2` until you are able to receive and send messages to it.

**Connecting to `node 2` via `websocat`**

```bash
.bin/websocat "$(echo "$HOPR_NODE_2_WS_URL" | sed "s/http/ws/")/?apiToken=$apiToken"
```

**Connecting to `node 2` via [Piesocket WebSocket Tester](https://www.piesocket.com/websocket-tester)**

```bash
ws://127.0.0.1:19502/?apiToken=^^LOCAL-testing-123^^
```

You can verify that you are connected by typing the command `address` and seeing an output similar to this:

```json
{"type":"log","msg":"admin > address\n","ts":"2022-02-02T19:17:48.431Z"}
{"type":"log","msg":"HOPR Address:  16Uiu2HAmKhrwGWcvaZ3ic5dgy7oFawmnELJGBrySSsNo4bzGBxHW\nETH Address:   0x4cD95E1deF16D5913255Fe0af208EdDe2e04d720","ts":"2022-02-02T19:17:48.435Z"}
```

### 2. Verify REST API connectivity for `node 1`

Using `curl` or any other HTTP client, verify you can reach `node 1`'s API

**Obtaining the address for `node 1` using `curl`**

```bash
echo -n $apiToken | base64 | xargs -I {} curl -s -H "Authorization: Basic {}" $HOPR_NODE_1_HTTP_URL/api/v2/account/address | jq
```

**Obtaining the address for `node 1` using [reqbin](https://reqbin.com/)**

_URL_

```bash
http://127.0.0.1:13301/api/v2/account/address
```

_Custom Header (default `apiToken` `base64`-encoded)_

```bash
Basic Xl5MT0NBTC10ZXN0aW5nLTEyM15e
```

If you sent a successful request, the response will look something like this:

```json
{
  "nativeAddress": "0x3a54dDE3ee5ACfd43C902cbecC8ED0CBA10Ff326",
  "hoprAddress": "16Uiu2HAmE9b3TSHeF25uJS1Ecf2Js3TutnaSnipdV9otEpxbRN8Q"
}
```

## Send messages

The HOPR protocol allows you to send private messages between nodes by using other nodes as relayers. Each message “hops” (hence the
name “HOPR”) until it reaches its final destination, its contents are known only to the final recipient. This is done automatically
by HOPR nodes, which pick a random path to send your message to your recipient.

The path consists of at least `2` nodes that have channels opened between each other. For instance, to send a message to `node 2`
from `node 1`, one path a message could take is `node 1 -> node 4 -> node 3 -> node 2`. Since HOPR clusters have channels open between all nodes, all possible paths are available.

To try this out, let's use the REST API from `node 1` and send a message to `node 2`, which we'll be able to see via our
WebSocket client connection.

### 1. Obtaining the address (`PeerId`) of `node 2`

Using `node 2`, type the following command in your terminal with `websocat` running or the WebSocket client interface:

```bash
address
```

You should see a response like the following:

```json
{"type":"log","msg":"admin > address\n","ts":"2022-02-02T19:17:48.431Z"}
{"type":"log","msg":"HOPR Address:  16Uiu2HAmKhrwGWcvaZ3ic5dgy7oFawmnELJGBrySSsNo4bzGBxHW\nETH Address:   0x4cD95E1deF16D5913255Fe0af208EdDe2e04d720","ts":"2022-02-02T19:17:48.435Z"}
```

As you can see, the address or PeerId of `node 2` is `16Uiu2HAmKhrwGWcvaZ3ic5dgy7oFawmnELJGBrySSsNo4bzGBxHW`. You can use that
information to send a message from `node 1`. Make sure to keep your WebSocket client connected to see any messages received by `node 2`

### 2. Sending a message to `node 2` from `node 1`:

To send a message from `node 1` to `node 2`, we need to use `node 1`'s REST API, specifically the `/messages` endpoint. Using `curl`
or any other HTTP client, send the following request:

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  "$HOPR_NODE_1_HTTP_URL/api/v2/messages/" \
  -H 'accept: */*' \
  -H "x-auth-token: $apiToken" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{
  \"body\": \"Hello world from Node 1\",
  \"recipient\": \"$HOPR_NODE_2_ADDR\"
}"
```

In the terminal of `node 2`, you will see something similar to this:

```json
{"type":"log","msg":"#### NODE RECEIVED MESSAGE [2022-02-03T21:48:13.845Z] ####","ts":"2022-02-03T21:48:13.845Z"}
{"type":"log","msg":"Message: Hello world","ts":"2022-02-03T21:48:13.846Z"}
{"type":"log","msg":"Latency: 668ms","ts":"2022-02-03T21:48:13.846Z"}
{"type":"message","msg":"Hello world","ts":"2022-02-03T21:48:13.847Z"}
```

Congratulations! You have sent your first message using the HOPR protocol!

### 3. Extra: Channels and tickets

You cannot send unlimited messages[^2]. Each message requires `tickets` and headers with signatures for claiming
balance updates in a `HOPR` token balanced payment channel. For every relayer you use (default `2`), you need to "attach"
`HOPR` tokens (`0.01` per relay) which are used to pay for the relayer's work. Tickets are settled in a single global entry
`HoprChannels` Ethereum contract.

The previous message worked because a cluster is configured by default to open a few channels and lock enough `HOPR`
tokens to send messages to at least `2` relayers. When a path used to relay has depleted (empty) or closed `channels`,
your message will not be forwarded. You can always see your open `channels` and their balance with the following command:

```bash
channels
```

You can see your balance via the following command:

```bash
balance
```

## HOPR Admin UI and REST API

We ran all these commands via our WebSocket API, but you can also see them via our web UI interface called `hopr-admin`.
To view the interface in your browser, simply paste your `HOPR_NODE_1_WS_URL`. You should be able to see an image like the following one:

[^1]:
    As defined in ["Running a local HOPR Cluster"](/developers/starting-local-cluster), a HOPR cluster is a set of HOPR nodes that are connected (i.e
    reachable) between each other and have opened funded channels between each other. This is also known as a [Complete
    Graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_graph), and although it is not required for successfully sending a message
    (i.e. you only need `1` path to a recipient when sending a message), it makes testing and developing HOPR apps easier.

[^2]:
    When a HOPR node uses the `/api/v2/messages` REST API endpoint to send a message, it will use a random path of at
    least `2` nodes as relayers. These messages cost `$HOPR` tokens because it pays each relayer accordingly to forward the
    packet. However, you can also send what is known as `0-hop` messages, which bear no cost but provides no privacy, as
    the message is sent directly to the recipient. The REST API endpoint does not expose this, but you can send a `0-hop`
    message via the HOPR admin UI or WebSocket client by typing `send ,$peerId message`.
