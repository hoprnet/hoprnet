## Installing the HOPR client

```

![DappStore](./images/DappStore-NR.png)

(**2**) It should bring up the latest version of the HOPR client. Click **Get** and wait for the download to complete.

That's all! You should now be able to find the HOPR client in your 'Packages'.

Simply, open the client and you should be greeted with the hopr-admin interface.

Your **security token** is set to `!5qxc9Lp1BE7IFQ-nrtttU`. You will need this to access hopr-admin.

If you are in the process of registering your node on the network registry, please complete the process [here](./network-registry-tutorial.md) before continuing.

Otherwise, the installation process is complete! You can proceed to our [hopr-admin tutorial](using-hopr-admin).
