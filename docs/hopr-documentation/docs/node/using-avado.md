title: Using an Avado Node
---

To set up your AVADO Node, follow the instructions that came with the box. If you have a HOPR PC Node, it will come with HOPR pre-installed. All you have to do is download the HOPR client to start interacting with your node!

:::caution Warning
Please withdraw all your funds and delete the old package before installing a new one.

## Installing the HOPR client

While connected to your AVADO's network or via a VPN, go to the following [link](http://my.ava.do/#/installer/%2Fipfs%2FQmPhSZTZbM6kd9VizvZpKDN3fQe5bqvCDooCBPYEUXdTcy). Just click the install button and wait until the download completes.

If you are unable to use the link above, search for this hash in the AVADO DappStore:

```
/ipfs/QmTjYk8f8SXyTKy8W9skPtKmx5FnV3oVHDegqPio1FtdoS
```

After you have installed the HOPR package, you can find the HOPR client in `my DApps`.

Your **security token** is set to `!5qxc9Lp1BE7IFQ-nrtttU`. You will need this to access the hopr-admin.

If you are in the process of registering your node on the network registry, please complete the process [here](./network-registry-tutorial.md) before continuing.

Otherwise, the installation process is complete! You can proceed to our [hopr-admin tutorial](using-hopr-admin).
