\subsection{Tickets aggregation}
The word aggregation means the process of combining things or amounts into a single group. 
HOPR adds an additional scaling layer that aggregates multiple tickets and redeems them within one transaction.
\\~\\ Since probabilistic payments cannot scale arbitrarily and ethereum gas fees are only increasing it makes sense to aggregate multiple tickets and redeem them within one transaction.
The preimage of a winning ticketis stored in the node’s database. 
\\~\\ The node sends ticket or several winning tickets $ticket_A$ and $ticket_B$ with the corresponding pre-images to the issuer who computes their aggregation $ticket_C$. 
\\~\\The issuer stores on chain $hash(ticket)$ of the redeemed tickets in a space-efficient data storage called Bloom Filters.
The issuer computes the modified Bloom Filter by XORing the previous version with the one after inserting the ticket.
\newline Once $ticket_C$ is sent to the smart contract, the intended version of the modified Bloom Filters is recovered by $bloom_{n+1} = bloom_n \vee diff$ and thereby invalidates $ticket_A$, $ticket_B$ as well as $ticket_C$.
